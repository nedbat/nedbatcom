New design:
- must
    + search button isn't square?
    + choose sans-serif
    + images (like in vax9000) have right-margin that adds extra width to <html> when the screen is narrow enough
        + remove fixed margin
        x create a flex place for multiple images?
    + videos (like in machete.html) don't shrink right, because they are iframes?
        + made the first break wide enough that it doesn't matter
    + how to make top_areas baseline-align with font-size:85% ?
    + mainpage
    + fix printstyle.css
    - grab the old design
    + write a blog post about it
    - tag page left hang too wide
    + text home nests too deep. Use H2

- next
    - get rid of jQuery:
        http://vanilla-js.com/
        https://github.com/supakeen/pinnwand/blob/02152c1ad5f07168eb31db5e0eb9686e299572a3/pinnwand/static/pinnwand.js
    - move #footer.sitetools into an include file
    - a11y
        + don't use aside, use nav
            + html5 says aside for a sidebar is fine. I added nav inside it.
        - add title to iframes
        - make a skip-to-main link?
        - check tab order
    + change <p align='center'> to figurep
        + first have to fix the handling of <figurep><a> in tools.xslt
        + rel=external should be for more than just http: and ftp:
    + more link fixing
        + fix explicit nedbatchelder.com links in .bx and .px
        + fix links to now-gone blog month pages: <a href='blog/200209.html#20020902T110606'>polyglot programs</a>
            + this is already done by fix_blog_links! :) :)
        + get rid of <abook> and <apage>
        + links in comments need http: added if missing.
    + make sidebar bullets be :content instead of content.
    + https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnedbatchelder.com%2Fblog
    - comments are bad html:  p1<br><br>p2<pre>code</pre>p3
    - search button image is different in different browsers
    - different logo images, so small screens get a smaller image
    - at some widths, " >> " leaves a leading blank
    - get rid of the month highlight when clicking a month.
    + "nedbat" in ultranarrow appears in the plain-text.
    - get rid of .first, do it with css
    + move svg style into its own css file, since so few pages need it

- nice
    - auto-widen code samples on hover, like https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

- a11y
    - role= attributes
    - aria-describedby for form fields
    - do the header levels have to make more sense?

- typography
    - widont?
    - sentence double-spacer?
    - only one sentence on mainpage when small?
    - Long words get &shy?
    - hanging-punctuation: only safari does it now, and it doesn't hang curly quotes!?
