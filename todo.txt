New design:
- must
    + search button isn't square?
    + choose sans-serif
    + images (like in vax9000) have right-margin that adds extra width to <html> when the screen is narrow enough
        + remove fixed margin
        x create a flex place for multiple images?
    + videos (like in machete.html) don't shrink right, because they are iframes?
        + made the first break wide enough that it doesn't matter
    + how to make top_areas baseline-align with font-size:85% ?
    + mainpage
    + fix printstyle.css
    - grab the old design
    + write a blog post about it
    - tag page left hang too wide
    + text home nests too deep. Use H2

- nice
    - change <p align='center'> to figurep
    - auto-widen code samples on hover, like https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
    + https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnedbatchelder.com%2Fblog
    - search button image is different in different browsers
    - different logo images, so small screens get a smaller image
    - role= attributes
    - get rid of the month highlight when clicking a month.
    - aria-describedby for form fields
    + "nedbat" in ultranarrow appears in the plain-text.
    - get rid of .first, do it with css
    + move svg style into its own css file, since so few pages need it
    - do the header levels have to make more sense?
    - widont?
    - sentence double-spacer?
    - only one sentence on mainpage when small?
    - Long words get &shy?
    - hanging-punctuation: only safari does it now, and it doesn't hang curly quotes!?
