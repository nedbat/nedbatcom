<p>FtpUpload.py provides intelligent FTP uploading of files,
using MD5 hashes to track which files have to be uploaded.
Each upload is recorded in a local file so that the next upload can skip
the file if its contents haven't changed.
File timestamps are ignored, allowing regenerated files to be properly
uploaded only if their contents have changed.
</p>

<p>Call <c>setHost()</c> and <c>setMd5File()</c>
to establish the settings for a session,
then <c>upload()</c> for each set of files to upload.
If you want to have
removed local files automatically delete the remote files, call
<c>deleteOldFiles()</c> once,
then <c>finish()</c> to perform the closing bookkeeping.
</p>

<code lang='python'><![CDATA[
fu = FtpUpload()
fu.setHost('ftp.myhost.com', 'myusername', 'password')
fu.setMd5File('myhost.md5')
fu.upload(
    hostdir='www', src='.',
    text='*.html *.css', binary='*.gif *.jpg'
)
# more upload() calls can go here..
fu.deleteOldFiles()
fu.finish()
