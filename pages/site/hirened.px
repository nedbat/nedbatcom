<p>I used to freelance but am now a full-time employee of <a href='http://edx.org'>edX</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a software developer with a long career, specializing in Python.  Whatever challenge you are facing,
    I can probably help you with it.  I have decades of experience with many technologies, and what
    I don't know, I can learn.  I'm an excellent communicator, able to bridge domains and bring
    people together.</p>

<p>Although my deepest skills are in Python, I am also fluent in Javascript, C, C++, SQL, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p>The best way to reach me is by <a href='mailto:ned@nedbatchelder.com'>email</a>. I'm on <a href='http://twitter.com/nedbat'>Twitter</a>,
    and I'm also nedbat in the <a href='irc://irc.libera.chat/#python'>#python</a> IRC channel on Libera.</p>
