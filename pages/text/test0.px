How do you know when
    you've gotten it right, and how do you know your code has stayed right
    even after you've changed it?</p><p>The best we know to do this is with automated testing.  Testing is a
    large topic, with its own tools and techniques.  It can be
    overwhelming.</p><p>In this talk, I will show you how to write automated tests to test your
    Python code.  I'll start from scratch. By the time we're done here, you
    should have a mystery-free view of the basics and even a few advanced
    techniques, of automated testing.</p><p>I'll include some pointers off to more advanced or exotic techniques,
    but you will have a good set of tools if you follow the methods shown
    here.</p><p>The concepts covered here work the same in Python 2 or 3, though the
    code is Python 2.  In Python 3, a few imports and module names would
    have to change.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#3"><img alt="Why test?" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_002.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>My main point here isn't to convince you to test, I hope you are reading
    this because you already know you want to do it.  But I have to say at
    least a little bit about why you should test.</p><p>Automated testing is the best way we know to determine if your code
    works.  There are other techniques, like manual testing, or shipping it to
    customers and waiting for complaints, but automated testing works much
    better than those ways.</p><p>Although writing tests is serious effort that takes real time, in
    the long run it will let you produce software faster because it makes your
    development process more predictable, and you'll spend less time fighting
    expensive fires.</p><p>Testing also gives you another view into your code, and will probably
    help you write just plain better code.  The tests force you to think about
    the structure of your code, and you will find better ways to modularize
    it.</p><p>Lastly, testing removes fear, because your tests are a safety net that
    can tell you early when you have made a mistake and set you back on the
    right path.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#4"><img alt="untitled" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_003.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>If you are like most developers, you know that you should be writing
    tests, but you aren't, and you feel bad about it.  Tests are the dental
    floss of development: everyone knows they should do it more, but they
    don't, and they feel guilty about it.</p><p>BTW: illustrations by my son Ben!</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#5"><img alt="Yeah, it's hard" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_004.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>It's true, testing is not easy.  It's real engineering that takes
    real thought and hard work.  But it pays off in the end.</p><p>How often have you heard someone say, "I wrote a lot of tests, but it
    wasn't worth it, so I deleted them."  They don't.  Tests are good.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#6"><img alt="Chaos!" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_005.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>The fact is that developing software is a constant battle against chaos,
    in all sorts of little ways.  You carefully organize your ideas in lines of
    code, but things change.  You add extra lines later, and they don't quite
    work as you want.  New components are added to the system and your previous
    assumptions are invalidated.  The services you depended on shift
    subtly.</p><p>You know the feeling: on a bad day, it seems like everything is out to
    get you, the world is populated by gremlins and monsters, and they are all
    trying to get at your code.</p><p>You have to fight that chaos, and the weapon you have is automated
    tests.</p><p>OK, enough of the sermon, let's talk about how to write tests.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#7"><img alt="Roadmap" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_006.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>The rest of the talk is divided into three parts:</p><ol>
        <li>We'll grow some tests in an ad-hoc way, examining what's good and
            bad about the style of code we get,</li>
        <li>we'll use unittest to write tests the right way,</li>
        <li>and we'll talk about a more advanced topic, mocks.</li>
    </ol><h1>First principles</h1><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#8"><img alt="First principles" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_007.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>We'll start with a real (if tiny) piece of code, and start testing
    it.  First we'll do it manually, and then grow in sophistication from there,
    adding to our tests to solve problems we see along the way.</p><p>Keep in mind, the first few iterations of these tests are not the good
    way to write tests.  I'll let you know when we've gotten to the right
    way!</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#9"><img alt="Stock portfolio class" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_008.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Here is our code under test, a simple stock portfolio class.  It simply
    stores the lots of stocks purchased: each is a stock name, a number of
    shares, and the price it was bought at.  We have a method to buy a stock,
    and a method that tells us the total cost of the portfolio:</p><!--[[[cog include_file("portfolio1.py", px=True) ]]] {{{ --><code lang="python">
# portfolio1.py

class Portfolio(object):
    """A simple stock portfolio"""

        #   [[name, shares, price], ...]
        self.stocks = []

    def buy(self, name, shares, price):
        """Buy `name`: `shares` shares at `price`."""
        self.stocks.append([name, shares, price])

    def cost(self):
        """What was the total cost of this portfolio?"""
        amt = 0.0
        for name, shares, price in self.stocks:
            amt += shares * price
        return amt

    where most programmers start with testing: play around with the code and
    see if it works.</p><p>Running it like this, we can see that it's right.  An empty portfolio
    has a cost of zero.  We buy one stock, and the cost is the price times the
    shares. Then we buy another, and the cost has gone up as it should.</p><p>This is good, we're testing the code.  Some developers wouldn't have
    even taken this step!  But it's bad because it's not repeatable.  If
    tomorrow we make a change to this code, it's hard to make sure that we'll
    run the same tests and cover the same conditions that we did today.</p><p>It's also labor intensive: we have to type these function calls each
    time we want to test the class.  And how do we know the results are right?
    We have to carefully examine the output, and get out a calculator, and see
    that the answer is what we expect.</p><p>So we have one good quality, and three bad ones.  Let's improve the
    situation.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#11"><img alt="Second test: standalone" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_010.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Instead of typing code into a Python prompt, let's make a separate file
    to hold test code.  We'll do the same series of steps as before, but
    they'll be recorded in our test file, and we'll print the results we
    get:</p><!--[[[cog include_file("porttest1.py", px=True) ]]] {{{ --><code lang="python">
# porttest1.py
from portfolio1 import Portfolio

p = Portfolio()

p.buy("IBM", 100, 176.48)

p.buy("HPQ", 100, 36.15)
print "With 100 HPQ @ 36.15: %s" % p.cost()

</code><!--[[[end]]] }}}--><p>This is better because it's repeatable, since we can run this test file
    any time we want and have the same tests run every time.  And it's low
    effort: running a file is easy and quick.</p><p>But we still don't know for sure that the answers are right unless we
    peer at the numbers printed and work out each time what they are supposed
    to be.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#12"><img alt="Third test: expected results" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_011.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Here we've added to our test file so that in addition to printing the
    result it got, it prints the result it should have gotten:</p><!--[[[cog include_file("porttest2.py", px=True) ]]] {{{ --><code lang="python">

print "With 100 HPQ @ 36.15: %s, should be 21263.0" % p.cost()

</code><!--[[[end]]] }}}--><p>But we still have to examine all the output and compare the actual
    result to the expected result.  Keep in mind, the code here is very small,
    so it doesn't seem like a burden.  But in a real system, you might have
    thousands of tests.  You don't want to examine each one to see if the
    result is correct.</p><p>This is still tedious work we have to do, we should get the computer to
    do it for us.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#13"><img alt="Fourth test: check results automatically" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_012.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Here we've used the Python assert statement.  You may not have run
    across this before.  It takes a condition, and evaluates whether it's
    true or not.  If it's true, then execution continues onto the next
    statement.  If the condition is false, it raises an AssertionError
    exception:</p><!--[[[cog include_file("porttest3.py", px=True, start=4) ]]] {{{ --><code lang="python">

    is incorrect, the assert statement will raise an exception.</p><p>Assertions like these are at the heart of automated testing, and you'll
    see a lot of them in real tests, though as we'll see, they take slightly
    different forms.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#14"><img alt="Fourth test: what failure looks like" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_013.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>There are a couple of problems with assertions like these.  First, all
    the successful tests clutter up the output.  You may think it's good to see
    all your successes, but it's not good if they obscure failures.  Second,
    when an assertion fails, it raises an exception, which ends our
    program:</p><!--[[[cog include_file("porttest3_broken.out", px=True) ]]] {{{ --><code lang="text">

</code><!--[[[end]]] }}}--><p>We can only see a single failure, then the rest of the program is
    skipped, and we don't know the results of the rest of the tests.  This
    limits the amount of information our tests can give us.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#15"><img alt="Getting complicated!" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_014.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>As you can see, we're starting to build up a real program here. To make
    the output hide successes, and continue on in the face of failures, you'll
    have to create a way to divide this test file into chunks, and run the
    chunks so that if one fails, others will still run.  It starts to get
    complicated.</p><p>Anyone writing tests will face these problems, and common problems can
    often be solved with standard libraries. In the next section, we'll use
    unittest, from the Python standard library, to solve our common
    problems.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#16"><img alt="Good tests" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_015.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Before we look at unittest, let's talk for a minute about what qualities
    make for good tests.</p><p>The whole point of a test is to tell you something about your code: does
    it work?  They are no use to us if they are a burden to run, so we need
    them to be automated, and they need to be fast.</p><p>Tests have to be reliable so that we can use them to guide us.  If tests
    are flaky, or we don't believe their results, then they could give us false
    results.  That would lead us on wild goose chases.  The world is chaotic
    enough, we don't want to add to it by writing tests that pose more
    questions than they answer.  To be reliable, tests must be repeatable, and
    they must be authoritative.  We have to believe what they tell us.</p><p>What they tell us must be informative. Think about your workflow when
    running tests: if the test pass, you go on to write more features, or you
    go outside and enjoy the sunshine.  But what happens when they fail?  Then
    you have to find out what is wrong with your product code so you can fix
    it.  The more the test can tell you about the failure, the more useful they
    are to you.  So we want our tests to be informative.</p><p>We also want them to be focused: the less code tested by each test,
    the more that test tells us when it fails. The broken code must be in the
    code run by the test.  The smaller that chunk of product code, the more
    you've already narrowed down the cause of the failure.  So we want each
    test to test as little code as possible.</p><p>This may seem surprising, often we're looking for code we write to do
    as big a job as possible.  In this case, we want each test to do as little
    as possible, because then when it fails, it will focus us in on a small
    section of product code to fix.</p><!--
    Think of it like this: if broken product code is
    a crime, then the line containing the bug is the perpetrator, and your test
    should narrow down the list of suspects as much as possible.  Don't think
    of your test as testing as little as possible, think of it as exonerating
    as much of your code as possible.

It gives
    us the infrastructure for writing well-structured tests.</p><p>The design of unittest is modelled on the common xUnit pattern that is
    available in many different languages, notably jUnit for Java.  This gives
    unittest a more verbose feeling than many Python libraries.  Some people
    don't like this and prefer other styles of tests, but unittest is by far
    the most widely used library, and is well-supported by every test tool.</p><p>There are alternatives to unittest, but it's a good foundation to build
    on.

    from unittest.TestCase, and usually has a name with the word Test in it.</p><p>The test methods all must start with the word "test_".  Here we have
    only one, called "test_buy_one_stock".  The body of the method is the test
    itself.  We create a Portfolio, buy 100 shares of IBM, and then make an
    assertion about the resulting cost.</p><p>This is a complete test.  To run it, we use the unittest module as a
    test runner.  "python -m unittest" means, instead of running a Python
    program in a file, run the importable module "unittest" as the main
    program.</p><p>The unittest module accepts a number of forms of command-line arguments
    telling it what to run.  In this case we give it the module name
    "test_port1".  It will import that module, find the test classes and
    methods in it, and run them all.</p><p>We can see from the output that it ran 1 test, and it passed:</p><!--[[[cog include_file("test_port1.out", px=True) ]]] {{{ --><code lang="text">

    mock object so we can manipulate it.</p><p>We mock out urllib.urlopen, and then set the value it should return. We
    use the same open file object that we did in the last example, which just
    mimics the bytes that Yahoo would return to us.</p><p>Then we can run the product code, which will call current_prices, which
    will call urllib.urlopen, which is now our mock object.  It will return our
    mocked return value, and produce the expected portfolio value.</p><p>Mock objects also have a handy method on them called
    .assert_called_with() that let us make assertions about the arguments the
    mock object was passed.  This gives us certainty that our code called the
    external component properly.</p><p>When the with statement ends, the mock.patch context manager cleans up,
    restoring urllib.urlopen to it original value.</p><p>The net result is a clean self-contained test double, with assertions
    about how it was called.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#49"><img alt="Test doubles" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_048.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Test doubles are a big topic all of their own.  I wanted to give you a
    quick taste of what they are and what they can do.  Using them will
    dramatically improve the isolation, and therefore the speed and usefulness
    of your tests.</p><p>Notice though, that they also make our tests more fragile.  I tested
    current_prices by mocking urllib.urlopen, which only works because I knew
    that current_prices called urlopen.  If I later change the implementation
    of current_prices to access the URL differently, my test will break.</p><p>Finding the right way to use test doubles is a very tricky problem,
    involving tradeoffs between what code is tested, and how dependent on the
    implementation you want to be.</p><p>Another test double technique is "dependency injection," where your code
    is given explicit references to the components it relies on.  This way, the
    dependencies are made more visible.  This also makes them more visible to
    the non-test callers of the code, which you might not want.  But it can
    also make the code more modular, since it has fewer implicit connections to
    other components.  Again, this is a tradeoff, and you have to choose
    carefully how deeply to use the technique.</p><h1>Also</h1><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#50"><img alt="Also" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_049.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Testing is a huge topic, there are many paths to take from here.</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#51"><img alt="Tools" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_050.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Other tools:</p><ul>

        <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.addCleanup">addCleanup</a> 
        is a method on test cases.  It lets you register clean up functions to
        be called when the test is done.  This has the advantage that partially
        set up tests can be torn down, and you can register clean up functions
        in the body of tests if you like.</li>
        
        <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html">doctest</a>
        is another module in the standard library for writing tests.  It
        executes Python code embedded in docstrings.  Some people love it, but
        most developers think it should only be used for testing code that
        naturally appears in docstrings, and not for anything else.</li>

        <li><a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/">nose</a> and
        <a href="http://pytest.org">py.test</a> are alternative test runners.
        They will run your unittest tests, but have a ton of extra features,
        and plugins.</li>

        <li><a href="http://ddt.readthedocs.org">ddt</a> is a package for
        writing data-driven tests.  This lets you write one test method, then
        feed it a number of different data cases, and it will split out your
        test method into a number of methods, one for each data case.  This
        lets each one succeed or fail independently.</li>

        <li><a href="/code/coverage">coverage.py</a> runs your code, and
        measures which lines executed and which did not.  This is a way of
        testing your tests to see how much of your product code is covered by
        your tests.</li>

        <li><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> is a tool for
        running tests of web sites.  It automates a browser to run your tests
        in an actual browser, so you can incorporate the behavior of Javascript
        code and browser behaviors into your tests.</li>

        <li><a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> and
        <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> are
        continuous-integration servers.  They run your test suite
        automatically, for example, whenever you make a commit to your repo.
        Running your tests automatically on a server lets your tests results be
        shared among all collaborators, and historical results kept for
        tracking progress.</li>

        <li>Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development where you
        write tests before you write your code.  This isn't so much to ensure
        that your code is tested as it is to give you a chance to think hard
        about how your code will be used before you write the code.  Advocates
        of the style claim your code will be better designed as a result, and
        you have the tests as a side-benefit.</li>

        <li>Behavior-driven development (BDD) uses specialized languages such
        as Cucumber and Lettuce to write tests.  These languages provide a
        higher level of description and focus on the external user-visible
        behavior of your product code.</li>

        <li>In this talk, I've focused on unit tests, which try to test as
        small a chunk of code as possible.  Integration tests work on larger
        chunks, after components have been integrated together.  The scale
        continues on to system tests (of the entire system), and acceptance
        tests (user-visible behavior).  There is no crisp distinction between
        these categories, they fall on a spectrum of scale.</li>

        <li>Load testing is the process of generating synthetic traffic to a
        web site or other concurrent system to determine its behavior as the
        traffic load increases.  Specialized tools can help generate the 
        traffic and record response times as the load changes.</li>

    testing.  Testing is a complicated pursuit, because it is trying to solve a
    difficult problem: determining if your code works.  If your code is
    anything interesting at all, then it is large and complex and involved, and
    determining how it behaves is a nearly impossible task.</p><p>Writing tests is the process of crafting a program to do this
    impossible thing, so of course it is difficult.  But it needs to be done:
    how else can you know that your code is working, and stays working as you
    change it?</p><p>From a pure engineering standpoint, writing a good test suite can itself
    be rewarding, since it is a technical challenge to study and overcome.</p><p>Here are our two developers, happy and confident at last because they
    have a good set of tests.  (I couldn't get my son to draw me a third
    picture!)</p><figurep href="text/test0/test0.html#55"><img alt="Questions?" scale="0.5" src="text/test0/test0_054.png"/></figurep>
