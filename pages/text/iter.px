    prefer to think of it as Fundamental.  Plenty of expert Python programmers
    aren't making enough use of the tools I'm going to talk about.</p><p>Python has a nice model of abstract iteration which can be used to
    increase the expressiveness of your programs.  Python's iteration tools are
    one of the most underused features of the language, especially by
    programmers coming from other "similar" languages.</p><p>My goal here is to show Python iteration in a light that would encourage
    programmers to explore more of its possibilities.</p><p>All programs iterate over data, of various sorts.  When using iteration,
    you should be as direct as you can, and you should use more abstractions to
    make your loops as clear and direct as you can.</p><h1>~ Iteration basics ~</h1><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#3"><img alt="~ Iteration basics ~" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/002.png"/></figurep><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#4"><img alt="Iteration" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/003.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Let's say you have a list of numbers, and you want to print each of
    them.  One way to do it is shown in the first code sample: start a counter
    at zero, and as long as the counter is less than the length of the list,
    access that element of the list, and print it. Then increment the counter,
    and continue on to the next element.  Eventually, the while loop will run
    over the whole list.</p><p>This while loop works, and is a least common denominator: this way of
    thinking about the loop can be written in almost any language.</p><p>In Python, there's a simpler way to have a loop that ranges from zero to
    N-1. You can use the idiom "for i in range(N)", as we see next.  Here i
    again takes on values starting with zero and going up to the last index of
    my_list.  This is the Python version of C or Javascript's classic for-loop
    structure.</p><p>C programmers coming to Python often end here: they are used to a loop
    that iterates over integers, and range() gives them a nice compact way to
    do it.</p><p>But Python gives us a much more natural way to loop over the values in
    my_list.  Why are we talking about integers?  This is like a Rube Goldberg
    machine.  We set up a mechanism to give us integers, when we don't want the
    integers at all, so the first thing we do with each integer is turn it into
    a list element.  We might has well have written, "the boot kicks the ball
    into the net, which tips the watering can..."</p><p>Rather than iterating over indexes, and using the index i to
    get the value we really want from the list, we can simply loop over the
    values directly.</p><p>The last code sample shows the right way to write this loop.  "for v in
    my_list" gives us each value in my_list in the variable v, with no need to
    fiddle around with the index i at all.  What started as a five-line while
    loop with two variables is now a two-line loop with only one.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#5"><img alt="The for loop" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/004.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>The for loop is Python's versatile swiss-army-knife iteration tool.  It
    can iterate over all sorts of Python objects.  Any Python object can be
    "iterable," which means it can provide a stream of values.  Any iterable
    can be used in a for loop.  The for loop extracts values from the stream,
    assigns them to the name, and execute the statements in the body once for
    each value.</p><p>On the face of it, this seems simple.  But this simplicity provides
    great power. The for loop can be used in all sorts of situations to iterate
    all sorts of values.  And you can often re-shape your iterations to use the
    for loop more powerfully.</p><p>An iterable in Python is any value that can provide a stream of values.
    In our first example, the list of numbers was the iterable, but there
    are lots of other examples.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#6"><img alt="Lists &#8658; elements" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/005.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>There are many different iterable objects in Python, and each provides
    its stream of values in its own way.  As we've seen, if you iterate
    a list, it will provide its elements in order.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#7"><img alt="Strings &#8658; characters" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/006.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>If you iterate a string, it will produce a stream of the characters in
    the string.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#8"><img alt="Dicts &#8658; keys" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/007.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>If you iterate a dictionary, it will give you its keys.  This might be a
    little surprising, what about the values?  Dictionaries are best thought of
    as a container of keys, where each key also has a value associated with it.
    If you want, you can choose to use methods on the dictionary to iterate
    over its values, or over its key/value pairs.</p><p>Notice that the keys appear in a surprising order.  Dictionaries have no
    inherent order.  When iterated, they produce their keys in an arbitrary
    order.  Each iterable can decide the semantics of its sequence.
    Dictionaries promise to give you all of the keys, with no extras, and no
    duplicates, but make no guarantee about the order of the keys.</p><p>This demonstrates an important point: iterating a value doesn't mean you
    can index into it.  Iteration only knows how to get the next value, it
    can't get the first, or the last, or the third-from-now.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#9"><img alt="Files &#8658; lines" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/008.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>An open file is iterable, its values are strings, one for each line in
    the file.  This is extremely convenient, since this is often the way text
    files are consumed, one line at a time.</p><p>In this example I've printed repr(line) so you can see that the lines
    still have a newline at the end, every byte in the file is provided
    somewhere.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#10"><img alt="Stdlib has interesting iterables" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/009.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>The standard library provides a number of other examples of iterable
    values.</p><p>The re module searches for a regex pattern in a string.  The finditer
    function takes a pattern and a string, and iterates over all the places
    that pattern matches that string.  It's a good way to process a number of
    pattern matches in a simple way.</p><p>In the os module, the walk function takes a directory name, and iterates
    over all the subdirectories in that tree.  This iterator is interesting
    because it's working on a tree structure, but linearizing it by producing
    subdirectories one after the other.</p><p>The itertools module provides dozens of tools for working with
    iteration.  The count() function produces integers forever.  Of course
    you'll need some logic to decide when to end.</p><p>The itertools module also provides tools for combining iterations.  The
    chain() function takes a number of sequences, and chains them together,
    first producing all the values from the first sequence, then the values
    from the second sequence, and so on.  In this example, the first sequence
    is repeat(17, 3) which simply produces 17 three times.  cycle() takes its
    sequence and cycles around it forever, so the sequence produced here is
    infinite: 17, 17, 17, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...</p><p>These are just a few examples of using iterables to represent a variety
    of kinds of iteration, and doing it naturally without resorting to index
    variables.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#11"><img alt="Other uses for iterables" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/010.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>In addition to provide lot of interesting iterable values, Python also
    uses iterables in lots of places, not just in for loops.  Here are a few
    examples.</p><p>The list() function creates a list using the values it gets from its
    iterable argument. Keep in mind, the argument can be any iterable.
    list(my_dict) will produce a list of the dictionary's keys.
    list(my_open_file) will produce a list of the lines of the file, and so
    on.</p><p>List comprehensions are a concise way to create a list using a
    computation on an iterable.  They are very powerful, but are outside the
    scope of this presentation.  Here we make a list of the values returned by
    f for each value in the iterable.</p><p>The sum() function takes an iterable, and returns the sum of all the
    values it finds.  The iterable has to be a stream of things that can be
    added.  The min() function takes an iterable of comparable values (such as
    strings or numbers), and returns the smallest value in the stream.  Of
    course there is a max() function as well, which returns the largest
    value.</p><p>The join method on a string takes a stream of strings, and joins them
    all together into one long string.</p><p>These are just a few examples of using iterables outside of for loops,
    as streams of values that can be passed to functions, computed with, and so
    on.</p><h1>~ Common questions ~</h1><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#12"><img alt="~ Common questions ~" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/011.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>When learning about Python's iteration, there are common questions that
    keep coming up.  Let's look at a few.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#13"><img alt="Q: How do I get the index?" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/012.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>OK, back to our list of numbers.  We know now that we can iterate it
    directly, without need for Rube Goldberg integers.  But sometimes you
    really need the index.  Perhaps you just want to print the values with
    their position.</p><p>Some will go back to the range(len()) twistiness, but there's a better
    way.</p><p>The second code example shows how to use the enumerate() function to
    get two values at each iteration: i is the index of the value, and v is
    the value.  Now we can print the value with its index, again without
    resorting to iterating over integers.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#14"><img alt="A: enumerate() makes useful pairs" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/013.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>In addition to looping over iterables, you can manipulate iterables to
    produce new iterables that might be more convenient for you.  The built-in
    enumerate() function takes one iterable, and produces a stream of pairs.
    Each value from the iterable is paired with a number, starting with
    zero.</p><p>In our example, the list "names" is given to enumerate() which iterates
    the list, giving the values "Eiffel Tower", "Empire State", "Sears Tower".
    It pairs those with the number 0, 1, 2, to produce a stream of pairs.</p><p>In the first code sample, we use list() to make a list of all the values
    enumerate() produces.  This gives us a list of pairs.</p><p>We can use multiple-name assignment to get those pairs as two separate
    values, as in the bottom example.  The variables num and name are assigned
    to the number of each name, and the name itself, from the list "names".
    This is a convenient way to iterate over the values in a stream while also
    using their index.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#15"><img alt="Iteration vs indexing" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/014.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>An important advantage to the enumerate style of numbering: it works
    with any iterable.  When iterating over integers, you need the second Rube
    Goldberg step of indexing into the iterable with the index.  Many iterables
    don't support this operation.  You can't index an open file to get the
    100th line, for example.</p><p>The enumerate() technique works with any iterable, and so is much more
    powerful, in addition to being more compact and direct.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#16"><img alt="The other bad way" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/015.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>By the way, another common style of getting the index of an iterable is
    shown here: keep a separate counter, and increment it to keep it in step
    with the enumeration.  This is just a goofy sidecar bolted on the side of
    your loop.  It works, but adds extra complexity.  If the loop is more
    complex than shown here, it is easy for it to become long enough that the
    index increment gets lost.  It's much better to keep the loop simple.
    Fewer moving parts mean fewer bugs.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#17"><img alt="Q: How do I loop over two lists?" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/016.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>OK, so we don't need to iterate over integers just to number the items
    in our iteration.  The next challenge from the integer-lovers is, "how do I
    loop over two lists at once?"</p><p>The integer way is to again loop over a range of integers, and then use
    list indexing on the two lists to get the corresponding values.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#18"><img alt="A: zip() makes pair-wise loops" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/017.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>But again, there's no need to resort to integers.</p><p>The zip() built-in function takes a pair of streams, and "zips" them
    together to produce a stream of pairs.  In this example, we have two lists:
    "names" has names in it, and "heights" has heights that go with each name.
    zip(names, heights) will produce a stream of pairs, each pairing a name
    with the corresponding height.  Using multiple assignment, we unpack the
    pairs into the variables name and height.</p><p>Notice again that because we don't rely on list indexing, zip() can work
    with arbitrary iterables, not just lists.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#19"><img alt="dict() accepts a stream of pairs" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/018.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Here's another example of the power of iterables.  The dict() function
    will accept a stream of key/value pairs, and construct a dictionary from
    them.  If we have two parallel lists, "names" containing strings, and
    "heights" containing numbers, zip(names, heights) will produce a stream of
    pairs, and dict() will use that stream, and produce exactly the dictionary
    we want.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#20"><img alt="Powerful" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/019.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>One last example of the power of iteration.  Suppose we've made our
    dictionary of buildings and their heights.</p><p>We can use a few different uses of the max() function to find the
    greatest height, the name and height of the tallest landmark, or just the
    name. A great deal of power can be packed into a concise expression.</p><p>Python's iteration primitives give you the power to loop over
    tall_buildings in a single bound!</p><h1>~ Customizing iteration ~</h1><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#21"><img alt="~ Customizing iteration ~" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/020.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>We've seen the power of Python's iteration primitives.  Let's talk about
    ways to customize your iterations.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#22"><img alt="Make your own iteration" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/021.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Another style of indirect iteration is iterating over a sequence but
    picking and choosing among the items.  Here we have a list of numbers, and
    we want to do_something() with the even ones.  In first code example, we
    loop over the numbers, and test each to see if it is even. Only if it is,
    do we perform our action.</p><p>An alternative is to write a function that accepts a sequence, and
    produces the new sequence we want.  The evens() function does this.  It
    iterates over its argument, making a list of the even values.  Then we can
    use it in our for loop to iterate over the even numbers directly.</p><p>This example has a problem, namely, that is makes an actual list of the
    even values.  We'll see in a bit how to avoid this.</p><p>In this case, the test for an even number in the loop isn't burdensome,
    but this is a toy example.  If the test were more complicated, or if it had
    to be performed in many places, it would be a clear win to abstract the
    selection into a function like evens().</p><p>By writing evens(), we're abstracting our iteration, and creating new
    sequences to iterate over.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#23"><img alt="Generators" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/022.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Generators are a way to create your own iterables by writing a
    function.</p><p>A normal function returns one value, with the return statement.  A
    generator looks just like a function, but instead of a return statement, it
    has one or more yield statements.  Calling the generator function creates
    an iterator, and iterating it runs the code in the function.  Each yield
    statement executed produces another value in the stream.</p><p>Here's a toy example of a generator, just containing two yield
    statements.  If you iterate it with a for loop, you can see that
    hello_world() produced a stream of two values, "Hello", and "world".</p><p>Real generators are not this simple, typically the body of the function
    would itself have a loop, with yield statements within it.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#24"><img alt="Evens generator" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/023.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>We can re-write our evens() function as a generator.  The code is almost
    the same, but instead of building a list and returning it at the end of the
    function, we simply yield the values as we find them.</p><p>We use it the same way: call evens(), passing it the iterable we want it
    to work on, and it returns an iterator that will produce the even values
    from it.</p><p>The old evens function made a list, and returned the entire list as its
    only value.  That meant that nothing would happen in the caller until
    evens() had examined the entire iterable sequence and stored all the even
    values.  For small inputs, that might be fine.</p><p>Our evens() generator will yield the first even number it finds, letting
    the caller do work before the whole sequence is examined.  Note this means
    it can work on indefinite or even infinite streams.</p><p>Generators have the advantage that they are lazy: they do no work until
    the first value is requested, and they only do enough work to produce that
    value.  Work after that doesn't happen until the next value is requested.
    This makes them use fewer resources, and usable on more kinds of
    iterables.</p><!-- {{{ --><p>Generators can be confusing.  They look very similar to functions,
    but have very important differences.  First, calling the generator doesn't
    immediately begin running the code in the generator, it simply creates
    an iterator.  When the for loop or other consumer of the iterator starts
    pulling values from the stream, then the code in the generator begins
    executing.</p><p>When a yield statement is encountered, execution is suspended, and the
    value is used as the next value in the stream.  With a regular function, a
    return statement ends the function for good.  But with a generator, the
    current state of the execution is remembered.  When the next value is
    requested from the iterable, execution continues in the generator where it
    left off, after the yield statement.  The next value in the stream is
    produced when a yield statement is executed again.  All the local variables
    in the generator retain their values for the whole course of the stream.
    This makes it a very convenient way to write iterables.</p><p>The iterator finally ends when the generator returns, either with an
    explicit return statement, or by executing the last statement in the
    generator.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#25"><img alt="Abstracting your iteration" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/024.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>With generators, we have a very powerful tool for abstracting iteration.
    Just as functions are great for abstracting a series of statements, and
    classes are great for abstracting a collection of data and the methods that
    operate on it, generators are great for abstracting iteration.</p><p>As a real-world example, consider a program that reads a text file and
    acts on the lines in it.  Our file can have comments, which are lines
    starting with '#', and can also have blank lines, both of which should be
    ignored.</p><p>Here's a sketch of the program.  We open the file, then loop over the lines
    in the file.  We strip the whitespace from the ends of the line, then consider
    whether the line starts with '#'. If it does, we continue the loop, which skips
    this line of text and goes on to the next line in the file.  Similarly, if the
    line is blank, we continue to the next line in the file.</p><p>Finally, if the line isn't a comment or blank, then we process it in whatever
    way we like.  When all of the logic is considered, this loop calls do_something()
    on all of the non-blank non-comment lines from the file.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#26"><img alt="Your own generator" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/025.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Our line-processing program works just fine, but it mixed together two
    concerns. The first is, what are the interesting lines in the file, and
    which should be ignored?  Second, what should we do with the interesting
    lines?  These two questions may have nothing to do with each other.  You
    may need to re-use the first, for example, in a larger program that
    processes a few different kinds of text files.</p><p>Using a generator, we can split this loop into two parts.  The first
    part, which lines are interesting, can be implemented as a generator.  Our
    interesting_lines() generator takes an open file and loops over its lines.
    It uses the same code as before to skip over comment or blank lines, but
    then instead of processing the interesting line, it simply yields it.</p><p>Now we can use interesting_lines(f) in a for loop, and the loop will
    only see the interesting lines, all the uninteresting stuff has been
    skipped in the generator.  This makes it easy for us to reuse the
    line-skipping logic in other loops.</p><p>Notice that our generator interesting_lines() is actually a pure filter:
    it accepts a line-producing iterable of any sort, it doesn't have to be an
    open file.  And it produces a stream of lines, by picking the ones it likes
    from the input stream.</p><p>Notice also that we have re-thought our iteration: in the original code,
    we were iterating over all the lines in the file, and "manually" skipping
    over the uninteresting ones.  With our new generator, we can think instead
    of iterating over the interesting lines in the file.  This lets us work at
    a higher level of abstraction.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#27"><img alt="Q: How do I break out of two loops?" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/026.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>As a last example of rethinking iteration, consider looping over a
    two-dimensional structure like a spreadsheet.  A simple way to do it is to
    use two nested loops: the first loops over the rows, and the second loops
    over the columns.  Together the two loop variables can be used to access a
    cell in the spreadsheet.</p><p>There's a problem with this, though: suppose we are checking the cells
    for some condition, and when we find the condition, we want to stop looking
    through cells.  There's no nice way to break out of two loops at once.  The
    break statement shown here will only break out of the column loop, and will
    leave the row loop untouched, so the search will continue from the
    beginning of the next row.</p><p>There are ways to write the code so that both loops will end, but they
    are messy and confusing.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#28"><img alt="A: Make the double loop single" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/027.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>A more interesting solution is to change the iteration by abstracting
    away the two-dimensional nature.  Here we have a generator called
    range_2d(): it takes a width and height, and produces a stream of pairs
    (x,y) that range over the entire 2D space of coordinates.  It does this
    using the same double-nested loop we had before, but now the loop body
    simply yields the tuple we need to represent the coordinates.</p><p>Our main loop now changes from a doubly-nested loop to a regular single
    loop.  Each iteration of range_2d() produces another coordinate pair, and
    we can process the coordinates just as we did before, except now when we've
    found the cell we want, we can just break out of the loop, and all is
    well.</p><p>This is a more unusual loop change than we've seen before.  Here we
    changed a double loop into a single loop by re-thinking what we were
    iterating over.  This is a better loop because it matches our own way of
    describing the loop.  No one would describe looking for a value in a cell
    by saying, "once for each row, look at every cell in the row," which is the
    English equivalent of our double loop. Instead, you'd say, "look at every
    cell in the spreadsheet," which is what our new loop says.</p><p>Our generator lets us define "look at every cell" abstractly so that our
    main program can use the most expressive way to get the job done.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#29"><img alt="Better: iterate cells" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/028.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>An even better solution would be for the spreadsheet to have a .cells()
    method that provided an iterator over all cells.  Notice our range_2d
    solution still meant talking about integers, though they were pairs of
    integers.</p><p>Iterating over pairs of integers when we really want to be iterating
    over cells is just another form of Rube Goldberg thinking.  Much better is
    to add custom methods to compound objects that let you iterate directly
    over the values you're interested in.</p><h1>~ Low-level iteration ~</h1><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#30"><img alt="~ Low-level iteration ~" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/029.png"/></figurep><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#31"><img alt="Lower level" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/030.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Before we talk about how to make your objects iterable, a quick word
    about the low-level mechanics of iteration.</p><p>There are really two kinds of objects involved in iteration you need to
    know about.  We've been talking about iterables, which are objects that
    consist of a number of values.  They can't actually be looped over
    directly, to do that, we ask an iterable for an iterator.  You can think of
    an iterable as an object with values in a sequence, and an iterator as the
    current position within that sequence.  For example, the pages in a book
    are iterable, and the bookmark is the iterator.</p><p>The important operation on an iterable is iter(), which will return an
    iterator.  And the only operation available on an iterator is next(), which
    either returns the next value, or raises StopIteration, a special exception
    that means the iteration is finished.</p><p>Iterators having only one operation is important, because it means
    Python's iteration mechanism can be applied to as broad a range of data as
    possible.  You can't ask if there will be a next value, you can't skip
    ahead values, you can't rewind the stream, you can't ask what the last
    value was, and so on and so on.</p><p>All you can do is ask for the next value, and you'll either get one, or
    you'll get a StopIteration exception.  Some iterables provide more
    operations, but the only one that is guaranteed is next().</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#32"><img alt="Low-level iteration" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/031.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>With the low-level next() operation, we can use iterables in other ways
    than just looping over them entirely.  For example, with an open file,
    we can read the first line with next(), then use a for loop to read the
    rest of the file.</p><p>Notice the for loop doesn't re-read the first line in the file.  An open
    file object is an iterator, it knows where it is in the file, and pulling
    values from it will give you the next line at the current position.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#33"><img alt="Making your object iterable" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/032.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>The ultimate way to abstract your iterations is to make your own objects
    iterable.  By implementing the special method __iter__, your object is
    iterable.  All __iter__ has to do is return an iterator of some kind.</p><p>The simplest way to do that is to use the iter() function on some
    collection you have.  Here we have a self.tasks list, and our __iter__ can
    simply return iter(self.tasks).</p><p>Once we do that, our object can be iterated just like any other Python
    value.  Here we use it in a for loop, but it can also be used in all the
    other ways iterators can.</p><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#34"><img alt="__iter__ generators" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/033.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>A more powerful way to write __iter__ is to use a generator.  Remember
    that calling a generator returns an iterator, just what __iter__ has to
    do.</p><p>Here we've changed our to-do list to only produce the not-done tasks
    when it's iterated.</p><p>Remember that your object can be iterable in more than one way.  You can
    have methods that produce iterators as well.  Here our to-do list has an
    .all() method that returns all the tasks, simply by returning an iterator
    from the self.tasks list.  The .done() method returns the done tasks, using
    a feature we haven't seen yet, a generator expression.</p><p>I used three different techniques for these three iterator methods, just
    as a demonstration of a range of possibilities. The power here is in
    providing customized iteration using all the tools Python gives us.</p><h1>~ Wrapping up ~</h1><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#35"><img alt="~ Wrapping up ~" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/034.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>There is much more in this topic than can be covered in a short talk:</p><ul>

        <li>The "iterator protocol" is the actual sequence of function and
        method calls that happen to create and consume iterables.  It can
        be useful for advanced uses of iterables.</li>

        <li>When you define a class, you can make it iterable by defining
        a __iter__() method.</li>

        <li>List comprehensions are a compact way to describe a list in terms
        of a computation over another iterable.  They can make your code very
        concise.</li>

        <li>Generator expressions are a lot like list comprehensions, but
        generate values on demand, like generators.</li>

        <li>itertools is a module in the Python standard library full of
        functions for creating, manipulating, and consuming iterables.</li>

    </ul><figurep href="text/iter/iter.html#36"><img alt="sum(slides)" scale="0.5" src="text/iter_pix/035.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>To summarize:</p><ul>
        <li>Iteration is a fundamental tool in all programming.</li>

        <li>Python has a simple yet powerful model for iteration that is used
        throughout the language and standard library.</li>

        <li>Using the tool that iterables provide, you can re-think your
        iterations to make them clearer, more concise, and more powerful.</li>
