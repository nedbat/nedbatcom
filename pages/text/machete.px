We love it for its flexibility and dynamism.
With discipline, we use Python in ways similar to stricter languages, and build
large systems successfully.</p><p>But at heart, Python is simpler and more fluid than other languages.
Sometimes you want this fluidity, but usually you don't.  Dynamic typing means
that names may have values you don't expect.  Where other languages offer
access control over the internals of objects, Python lets you examine and
change anything.  All of your program's data is on the heap, and can be used
throughout your program.</p><p>All of this flexibility can be a powerful tool, but sometimes, things go
wrong.  The flexibility comes back to bite us, and causes problems that we have
to debug.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#3"><img alt="Use it to your advantage" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/002.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>OK, Python's lack of rules got us into a mess.  Let's use that freedom and
power to figure out what's going on, so we can solve the problem.</p><p>We'll look at a few real problems that cropped up in real projects.  We'll
debug the problem using dirty tricks to get at the information we need.  Along
the way, we'll examine how some Python mechanisms work.</p><p>These techniques are not for use in real programs! They are temporary hacks
to get you out of a tight place. When you are in a jungle, a machete is a very
good way to get out, but for real work, you should build real paved roads with
signs and painted lines.</p><p>Ideally, you'd prevent these bad situations from happening in the first
place.  I'm mostly not going to talk about how to avoid the problems: there are
lots of talks out there that can help you build properly from the start.  This
talk is about using Python's flexible power to untangle yourself once you've
gotten into trouble.</p><p>All of the code in this talk is meant to be used, and then discarded.  Once
it has served its purpose of getting you the information you need to understand
the problem, it should be deleted.  It is all hacky, and all "wrong" on some
level.</p><p>By the way, a few of these cases I've written up in more detail on my blog.
I'll provide links to those posts as we go.</p><h1>Case 1: Double importing</h1><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#4"><img alt="Case 1: Double importing" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/003.png"/></figurep><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#5"><img alt="The Problem" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/004.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>We had a problem where our modules were being imported more than once.
Since they contained class definitions, this meant our classes were being
defined twice.  It's never been a good idea to live with this situation, but
Python won't complain about it, and often, it doesn't cause any issues.  But
recent versions of Django complain about it, which is how we discovered it was
happening.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#6"><img alt="Modules" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/005.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>When you import a module, the .py file is found, and executed, and the
results become the attributes of the module.</p><p>Modules are only executed once, because the sys.modules dictionary keeps
track of all the modules that have been imported.  Once a module has been
imported, subsequent import statements simply find the module in sys.modules,
and return it, rather than executing the file again.</p><p>The first time a module is imported, Python has to find a .py file for the
module.  sys.path is a list of directories that Python uses to look for .py
files.  Each directory is examined for the .py file.  When the file is
found, it is executed, a module is made from the result, and the module is
stored in sys.modules.</p><p>With all this machinery to ensure files are only executed and imported once,
how are ours being imported twice?  We could read the code, or use grep to look
for reasons.  But one of the consequences of Python's dynamic nature is that
static analysis like that is difficult.</p><p>So instead of static analysis, we'll use dynamic tools.  Let's run the code,
and get it to tell us what's going on.  This theme runs through all of the
cases we'll look at: rather than try to analyze the code, we'll run code to
understand it.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#7"><img alt="Finding double imports" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/006.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>To find the problem, we'll take advantage of the fact that importing a
module really executes the code in the module.  Classes and functions are
defined in a module because the class and def statements in the .py file are
executed.  Often, it's easy to think of modules as just containing classes and
functions, but they are really executable statements that define classes and
functions.</p><p>Whatever code you put at the top-level of a module, it will execute when the
module is imported.  There is no special "just define classes and functions"
mode that imports your module.  The code is really run, and any statement can
be in a module.</p><p>So if we put code into one of our double-imported modules, it will run,
twice.  The code we put in uses inspect.stack to examine the current state of
the call stack. This will tell us who is importing the module.</p><p>If you haven't looked at the inspect module, go take a peek.  It has lots of
interesting functions for getting information about all kinds of things.
inspect.stack returns a list of tuples, one for each frame in the call stack.
The tuples include the name of the function, the filename and line number, and
a list of source lines around the call site. It's a great way to pinpoint where
you are in your program.</p><p>Here I'm formatting the function name, file name, and line number, into one
line for compact output.</p><p>I'm also opening a temporary file for output, and writing the results to it.
I do this so I don't have to worry about whether stdout is being captured, or
where it is going.  By opening a specific file, for appending, I can be sure
about where my output is going.</p><p>This is the "wrong" way to log, but I don't care. I didn't want to fiddle
with the right ways, and this code is only temporary.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#8"><img alt="Results" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/007.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>The results look like this.  The way I've formatted the stack, the function
name is to the left of the colon, and the file name and line number are to the
right.  In this case, the function name isn't that useful, since what we're
looking for is the file that is importing the doubly-imported module.  The
import statements won't be inside a function, so it's reported as &lt;module&gt;
instead.</p><p>With these results, we have two files to examine, the last one in each stack
trace: second/summary.py and first/admin.py.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#9"><img alt="Overlapping sys.path" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/008.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Once we looked at those two imports, we could see what was wrong.  This slide
shows a simplified version of the problem.</p><p>In our source tree, we had files that were accessible through two different
entries in sys.path.  The asterisks show the directories that were in sys.path.
The file that was being imported twice was project/thing/apps/first/models.py.</p><p>In one file, it was imported as "thing.apps.first.models", and was found via
the "project" sys.path entry.  In the other file, it was imported as "first.models"
and was found via the "project/thing/apps" sys.path entry.  The first import created
a "thing.apps.first.models" key in sys.modules.  The second import looked for a 
key of "first.models", didn't find it, and then imported the same file again.</p><p>The fix was to choose one style of import, and stick with it throughout the
code.</p><!-- Where i fixed them: https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/9988/files --><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#10"><img alt="&#9758; Lessons &#9756;" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/009.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Some things we took advantage of here:</p><ul>
    <li>Importing modules really executes code.  Good practice is to avoid
    code with side-effects that runs at import time, but in our case, it was
    exactly what we needed.</li>

    <li>Hard-coding details simplifies the hack.  We wrote directly to a temp
    file of our own choosing.  We put the code directly into the module in
    question.</li>

    <li>We can do things as wrong as we like, since the code will be deleted
    once it's given us the answers we need anyway.</li>
</ul><h1>Case 2: Finding temp file creators</h1><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#11"><img alt="Case 2: Finding temp file creators" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/010.png"/></figurep><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#12"><img alt="The Problem" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/011.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Many of our tests create temporary files or directories.  The good tests
properly clean them up at the end of the test run. (By the way: if you are
using unittest to write your tests, definitely use addCleanup, it's much better
than tearDown.)</p><p>The bad tests weren't cleaning up their temporary files and directories.
Finding those tests was difficult, because they weren't written as simply as
the example here. The temporaries were created in helper functions, making it
harder to find the places where a temporary was being made but not cleaned
up.</p><p>We want information about who creates the files. One way would be to note
the name of each temporary file created, along with the call stack that made
it.  Then when the test suite finishes, we could look up the names of the
marooned files to see where they came from.</p><p>I took a different approach: since we only care about the files that remain
when the tests are done, what if we write the information we need into the
files themselves?  We can't write our own data into the content of the files,
since the content is being used by the tests.  But the file names are
essentially arbitrary anyway, so we can write information there.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#13"><img alt="Monkeypatching" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/012.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>To do anything special during the creation of temporary files, we'll
monkeypatch functions in the tempfile module.  Monkeypatching is the colorful
name for changing someone else's code at runtime by injecting your own code
into their namespace.</p><p>For example, to change how mkdtemp works, we can define our own function
with the same calling signature, and then assign it to tempfile.mkdtemp.  Now
unsuspecting product code that calls tempfile.mkdtemp will actually be running
our function, rather than the code in the standard library.</p><p>This works because no names are special in Python: mkdtemp is an ordinary
attribute of the tempfile module, and can be reassigned just as any other name
can be. This may seem odd: the standard library feels like it should be
unchanging, the rock on which we build our programs.  But the standard library
is made of Python modules like your own code is. Any name can be
reassigned.</p><p>Monkeypatching can be very powerful, since you can hijack any name that
other parts of your program are using.  It can also be dangerously chaotic.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#14"><img alt="Read the source!" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/013.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>One of the things that can be tricky to get right when monkeypatching is
what exactly to patch.  In our case, there are a handful of different tempfile
functions that could be involved.  And we don't want to take over the entire
function, we just want to change what names the files get.</p><p>Reading the source in tempfile.py, it turns out that all of the functions
that create temporary files or directories make use of the same helper,
_get_candidate_names.  This function generates a sequence of possible file
names. It's responsible for the typical random names you see in temporary
files.  The functions then try each name in turn, looking for one that isn't
already being used.</p><p>If we monkeypatch _get_candidate_names, we'll have killed two birds with one
stone: we'll centrally affect all of the functions that can create temporary
files, and we'll only affect the file names they create, not how they create
the files, or what details they return.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#15"><img alt="Running code on startup" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/014.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Another factor that complicates monkeypatching is that you have to patch the
function before it gets called.  You might also need to patch the function
before it is imported, depending on how it's imported.  For the most effective
monkeypatch, you want to run your patching code before any other code in the
program.</p><p>Ideally, we'd have a way to run the monkeypatch before the main program.
But Python doesn't have a feature for running a preamble before the real
program.  Luckily it has a way we can sneak code into the startup of the
interpreter.</p><p>One of the ways that installed packages are referenced is by a
Python-specific form of symbolic link called a .pth file.  These small files
usually just contain the name of another directory to include when searching
for packages.</p><p>But if a line in a .pth file begins with "import", then the line is
executed!  We can use this, along with the knowledge that code in imported
modules is truly executed, to get code to run as early as possible in the
program.</p><p>We create a file called first_thing.py, and put in it all the code that we
want to run first thing.  Then we create a file in the site-packages directory
called 000_first.pth.  It imports first_thing.  We name the file 000_first.pth
because .pth files are processed alphabetically.  Our name will ensure that our
code is run even before other .pth files are processed.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#16"><img alt="The sneak" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/015.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Now that we have a way to run code on startup, here's the patch itself.  We
define my_get_candidate_names to yield possible names for the temporary file.
We save the original _get_candidate_names function so that we can use it as
part of our function.  Our function uses our old friend inspect.stack,
concatenating the last few source file names and line numbers into something
compact enough to fit in a file name.</p><p>We monkeypatch tempfile._get_candidate_names, and now any tempfile function
that makes temporary files will have our stack traces in their file names.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#17"><img alt="&#9758; Lessons &#9756;" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/016.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Lessons:</p><ul>

    <li>You can read the standard library.  This simple fact is sometimes
    overlooked. Even before we get to monkeypatching, just being able to
    read the standard library code is a powerful way to be able to
    understand what is happening in your program.</li>

    <li>You can patch the standard library.  It's mostly just Python code like
    anything else.  You can change how it works to get some leverage over a
    thorny problem.  Don't do it for real code, but for emergencies, it can be
    very helpful.</li>

    <li>.pth files are normally a small invisible part of your Python
    installation, but we can use them to inject code at startup time.

    </li><li>Here we used a clever trick of writing information into the names of
    temporary files.  Often when debugging large systems, there are parts
    that are not as accessible as you'd like.  Think creatively about the
    information you need, where it is, and where you can put it so that you can
    see it well.</li>

imported.  We had "import xblock", intending to find "apps/xblock.py", but we
were importing "lib/xblock.py" instead.  But "lib" wasn't on the path, so how
was it being imported?</p><p>Examining sys.path where the import was happening (by just adding a print
statement before the import!), there was a new incorrect entry that had been
added to sys.path.  What put it there?</p><p>We already knew we had sys.path manipulation that we were not proud of, so
maybe there were others to find.  A check of our sources proved that we weren't
doing it.  Some third-party code must be at fault.  We couldn't grep all of the
third-party modules we were using.  How to find the culprit?</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#20"><img alt="Data breakpoints" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/019.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>What would be great is a way to break into the debugger when a certain piece
of data is changed.  In this case, the incorrect entry in sys.path was being
added as the first element, and it ended with "/lib".  We want to stop in the
debugger when a condition is true: sys.path[0].endswith("/lib").</p><p>The standard Python debugger, pdb, doesn't have this feature.  You can set a
breakpoint at a particular line, with a condition.  But we wanted a condition
untethered from a line of source code.  We wanted to stop in the debugger when
the condition became true, no matter what line of code was running.</p><p>Python debuggers (and other tools, like coverage measurement) are built on a
feature called the "trace function."  This is a Python function that is called
for every line of running program.  Every time a new line is executed, the
trace function is called to track the program's progress.</p><p>Since our condition is so simple, it's easy to write a trace function to do
what we want: check the condition, and if it's true, break into the
debugger:</p><code lang="python">
def trace(frame, event, arg):
    if sys.path[0].endswith("/lib"):
        pdb.set_trace()
    return trace

sys.settrace(trace)
</code><p>To be honest, I wasn't sure what would happen if I tried to start the
debugger from inside a trace function.  That seemed particularly twisty, but
this trace function was simple enough to write and try, I figured I'd give it a
shot. This is classic machete-mode style: there was a good chance this wouldn't
work at all, but it was easy to try.</p><p>It worked great: with this trace function in place, the test suite ran
(really slowly!), and revealed that our test runner, nose, was adding the entry
to sys.path. A little more investigation revealed that this was configurable,
so it was easy for us to disable.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#21"><img alt="&#9758; Lessons &#9756;" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/020.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Lessons:</p><ul>

    <li>Problems might not be in your code.  Everything is running together
    in one process.  Python doesn't provide access control in classes, so code
    can be misbehaving from surprising places.</li>

    <li>Dynamic analysis is very powerful.  Rather than use static analysis
    (like grep, though it feels funny to bestow such a fancy term on good
    old grep), coming at it from a dynamic point of view found us the
    answer more quickly.  You want to know who is changing data? Watch the
    data.</li>

    <li>Python has some big hammers: a trace function can not only observe
    your entire program running line-by-line, it can modify values, and even
    change what line will run next.  It underpins every debugger, so whatever
    debuggers can do, it can do.</li>

student-specific seed so that if a student revisits a problem, they will see
the same problem each time.</p><p>We were seeing that the first time the problem generation ran, it would get
one set of values, but then subsequent runs would get different, but consistent
values.</p><p>The "first is different than the rest" factor made me think that something
was happening during import.  Remember that modules are executed when they are
first imported, but subsequent imports just use the stored module object.</p><p>There were two ways the random sequence could be changing: either something
was re-seeding the random number generator, or something was eating some random
numbers from the sequence.</p><p>A little experimentation in the interactive interpreter showed that one

planting a booby trap.</p><p>We replace random.random with a function that will raise an exception when
called.  Then we can run the code, and examine the traceback to see what is
consuming the random number.</p><p>The code is very simple: 1/0.  Dividing one by zero will raise a
ZeroDivisionError.  This is extremely handy. It's easy to drop into some code
when you want to see if it executes.  The ZeroDivisionError it raises is an
unlikely exception, so you can be sure it's yours.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#25"><img alt="Booby-trapped random" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/024.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Here we run the code again, and our one-over-zero finds the problem quickly.

constructor had a default argument with a random value.  Default values are
evaluated once, when the function is defined.  So this random.random() call
happened during import.</p><p>This library shouldn't be doing this, but as an extra bonus, that default
value is never used, because the constructor was always called with an explicit
value for that argument.</p><figurep href="text/machete/machete.html#26"><img alt="&#9758; Lessons &#9756;" scale="0.5" src="text/machete_pix/025.png"/></figurep><!-- {{{ --><p>Lessons:</p><ul>

    <li>Exceptions can be a good way to get information from deep inside your
    program.  Another trick: raise an exception with data in its message.</li>

    <li>Don't be afraid to blow things up: in this case, the monkeypatch
    destroys the program, but it gives us useful information.</li>

    <li>Some of these techniques require a bit of luck: if the offending call
    to random() wasn't the first one, we wouldn't have found it, because our
    booby trap stops the program on the first call.</li>

    <li>Avoid mutating globals.  One of the causes of this problem was that our
    code, and the third-party code, were using a single global random number
    sequence.  We were sharing global mutable state.  The best solution to this
    problem was to create our own private Random instance, and use that.  Then
    we could be sure that we were getting numbers from the sequence we
    seeded.</li>

    <li>A common mistake when debugging programs is to assume that something
    else is at fault: the compiler, the helper libraries, anything.  Usually,
    this is wrong: it's usually your own code that is to blame.  But sometimes,
    it really is someone else's fault.</li>
