    <p>High-uncertainty components in complex systems.</p>

    <p>OK, that's not the real title. It's fake high-tech jargon designed to
    appeal to all you techies.  I do want to talk about high-uncertainty
    components and how they interact, but there's a simpler word for the ones I
    want to talk about: People.</p>

    <p>I want to talk about how we interact with each other. As engineers, we
    can fall into the trap of approaching people the way we approach inanimate
    components we use.  It can go badly, because people don't work like
    electronics or software.</p>

    <p>We can tend to do this for a few reasons: either, we expect everything to
    work like engineering components, or we don't think we're good at dealing
    with people, or we don't think it's important to deal well with people.</p>

    <h1>Soft skills</h1>
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>Sometimes we call these "soft" skills.  Some people frown on this term,
    because it makes them seem lesser, simple things that anyone can do, or not
    as important somehow.</p>

    <p>I don't think of soft skills as lesser. The only reason some people think
    of them as lesser is because as a field, we value the hard edges of hard
    skills.  Rigid rules and quantitative measures.  Your Python syntax is
    either right or it's wrong.</p>

    <p>Soft skills have none of those rules and guardrails. They're all squishy
    and vague and subjective. There's no linter for Slack conversations. That's
    exactly what makes them difficult, especially for quantitative people like
    us.</p>

    <p>If it helps, you can think of this as emotional intelligence, which has
    that hard-sounding word "intelligence" in it.</p>

    <p>Let's face it: people are terrible.  But only if you think they are going
    to work like technical components. They don't work that way.</p>

    <p>Let's consider people through the lens of some engineering qualities.
    What are the characteristics we value about components in systems, and how
    do people stack up?</p>

    <h1>Non-standard</h1>
    <img class="fullheight" style="height:70%" src="img/ben/no-standards.png">
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>First off, people are not standardized.  Everyone is different, sometimes
    in small ways, sometimes in big ways.  What they know, how they speak, how
    they work, what they like, what they don't like, and so on.</p>

    <p>You can't treat people as interchangeable components. What works for one
    person can be really bad for another.  You have to adjust for their
    differences.</p>

    <h1>No docs</h1>
    <img class="fullheight" style="height:70%" src="img/ben/no-docs.png">
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>To make matters worse, people don't come with documentation.  When you
    meet someone new, they don't hand you a manual explaining how they are
    different than someone else.  Sometimes there's a bio, or a LinkedIn
    profile, but that rarely tells you the really important things to work
    smoothly with someone.</p>

</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>Because everyone is different, and they don't come with instructions,
    people are unpredictable. Just because they know one thing, you might not be
    able to guess that they know another thing.  If they have an opinion on a
    particular topic, it doesn't mean you can predict how they will feel about
    another topic.  And they may change from day to day.</p>

    <img class="incremental fullheight" style="height:70%" src="img/ben/hidden-state-2.png">
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>One of the things that makes people unpredictable is that they have a lot
    going on inside, very little of which you can see.  In software design we
    talk about avoiding mutable global data because it can have far-reaching
    effects that are hard to reason about.</p>

    <p>People are full of mutable globals, and you can't see them.  Maybe they
    didn't like their breakfast, or they're worried about a sick child.  Maybe

    <p>Let's get into how to talk to people.</p>

    <p>Except since you are engineers, you might not naturally want to talk to
    people, so let's think of it differently: People, the API User's Guide.</p>

    <p>We can look at how talking to people works and what happens in those
    interactions.</p>

    <p>BTW, when I say talking, I mean any method of communicating with
    someone. It could be talking, it could be typing in Slack, it could be an
    email.  The same basics apply.</p>

    <p>And just to be clear: I am not a psychologist.  I'm an engineer who has
    spent years reverse-engineering people and debugging interactions. I've read
    the tracebacks of lots of discussions.</p>

    <p>I've learned things the hard way.  And I still don't always get it right!
    There are definitely people here today that I have had conflicts with.  I am
    sorry for that.  And there will be conflicts and miscommunications in the
    future.  It happens.  The important thing is to learn and try to do
    better.</p>

    <p>None of this is easy. But it is important.</p>

    <h1>Information + Sentiment</h1>
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>Here's an important central idea: every message you send to a person will
    be heard as having two parts: information and sentiment.</p>

    <p>For a lot of what we say to each other, the information is the important
    part. I'm trying to tell you something, or you are asking me for something,
    or whatever.  This is the part engineers find it easy to focus on: what are
    the facts, the request, and so on.</p>

    <p>But every message also carries a sentiment, whether you want it to or
    not.  Sentiment might not be the right word: maybe emotion is better, or
    mood or the energy of a message.  Underestimating this is where we can get
    into trouble.</p>

    <p>Usually, information is the explicit part of the message: most of the
    words are the hard-edged facts we want to convey. They are easy to see.  The
    sentiment is usually much more subtle.</p>

</div><!-- }}} -->

<div class="slide">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 20%; font-size: 600%">
        <span style="color: green">Yes</span>

        <span style="color: red">No</span>
    </h1>
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>Sentiment and emotion are complex topics, of course, so let's simplify
    them for our purposes.  At a really really basic level, I think of
    every message as being either a Yes or a No, of varying intensity.</p>

    <p>Words can welcome us in, or they can push us away. They can give us a
    good feeling or a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>People are social emotional creatures.  They need to understand how you
    feel about them.  You've heard of "sentiment analysis" tools that read
    tweets, and try to figure out how people are feeling about Nike sneakers?
    People around you are doing that all the time, but they're doing it to your
    messages, to figure out how you feel about them.</p>

</div><!-- }}} -->


<div class="slide">
    <h1>Defaulted sentiment</h1>
    <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 38%">
    <li class="incremental">1: &nbsp;History</li>
    <li class="incremental">2: &nbsp;Similarity</li>
    <li class="incremental">3: &nbsp;"Bad"</li>
    <li class="incremental">4: &nbsp;Hidden State</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>The problem is, sentiment can be subtle enough that the recipient infers
    or defaults it. If the sentiment in your message isn't clear enough, the
    recipient will fill it in for you, and not always in the way you want.</p>

    <p>How is missing sentiment filled in?</p>

    <p>First, your history together will be the biggest source of fill-in
    material.  If you're friends with someone, and have a long history of
    positive interactions, then messages will be mostly assumed to be
    positive. Or, if you have a long history of conflict, that history will
    negatively color every interaction.</p>

    <p>If your history is short or non-existent, then the sentiment might depend
    on perceived similarity.  The recipient will judge how similar you two seem
    to be.  The more similar, the more likely your message will be considered
    positive.</p>

    <p>What do I mean by similar? Who knows!? It could be age, gender, haircut,
    clothing style, taste in music, laptop stickers, it could be anything at
    all.  As an example, we are all here at PyCon, and that makes us all similar
    in a certain way.  We are members of a community.  The more you have in
    common, the more likely your ambiguous message will be welcomed.</p>

    <p>If you have no history, and you don't seem that similar, then
    you might as well assume that the defaulted sentiment will be "Bad."  Maybe
    it won't be, but you are at the mercy of all of that hidden state we talked
    about.</p>

    <p>Finally, that hidden state we talked about will come into play. It will
    color how your message is received, without you even knowing it.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind: this is not conscious on the listener's part.  They aren't
    trying to assume the worst about you. They are getting words from you and
    trying to piece together both the information and the sentiment.  They want
    to hear you, but they are also trying to understand their place in a chaotic
    world.  They're doing what people do.</p>

    <p>Maybe this is obvious, but: if your recipient feels negative energy in

    information, that the situation is unclear, but the helper is taking some of
    the fault.  They are lowering themself, which again levels the field and
    helps put the asker at ease.</p>

    <p>In general, it can help to make yourself the subject of the sentence.
    "You" sentences can seem aggressive. "I" sentences are more humble, and more
    honest. You can't know another person's state of mind, but you can know
    yours.</p>

    <p>Being humble and letting go of some hard-earned status can be difficult.

    <p>One obvious way to be sure your sentiment is understood is to be very
    direct with it.  When you use more words, you can say things that are just
    sentiment.</p>

    <p>One strategy is to always start and end with a Yes, even if you need to
    have more difficult messages in the middle. Think of it as a Yes
    Sandwich.</p>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>Gutenberg's big advance was how to produce the type.  Printers need many
    uniform pieces of type to produce pages with consistent designs.</p>

    <p>The process started by carving a reverse-image letter at actual size into
    the end of steel bar called a punch.</p>

    <p>The punch is then driven into a bronze plate called a matrix. The matrix
    is put into the bottom of the mold, molten metal is poured repeatedly into
    the mold, and the result is many pieces of uniform type.</p>

    <p>Punchcutting was a difficult job.  The punchcutter worked in metal
    at tiny sizes, carving reversed letters in steel.</p>

    <p>How would a punchcutter assess their progress?  It's too hard to use the
    punch to make a matrix, use the matrix in a mold to make some type, put the
    type in a press, ink it, and make a page.  Even then, it was an ordeal to
    get your work into production!</p>

    <p>The punchcutter had a simpler way: use a candle flame to coat the punch
    with soot, then press the punch onto a piece of paper.  The resulting image
    reads correctly with a good black impression, and cleans up quickly.</p>

    <p>We use the same term they did for our quick checks of progress: a smoke
    test.  I know: there are other etymologies for smoke test, but I think this
    is the right one.  Fight me!</p>

    <p>OK, now we have lots of type, how do we make pages?  A person called a

    type in specific compartments.</p>

    <p>The trays were arranged like this. The common small letters are in the
    bottom tray, and the less-needed capital letters are in the top tray.</p>

    <p>They aren't called bottom tray and top tray though.  The trays are
    called cases.  This is the lower case, and this is the upper case, words
    that to this day everyone uses to describe these letters.  Remember: a
    case-insensitive regex is one that doesn't care whether the chunks of metal
    come from the bottom wooden tray, or the top wooden tray.</p>

    <p>Let's look at the layout of the lower case: the most common letters are
    in larger compartments near the center of the case, with less common
    letters in progressively smaller compartments farther out.  It's an
    ergonomic layout that takes letter frequency into account.</p>

    <p>The upper case is different: the compartments are all the same size,
    laid out alphabetically A to Z, except J and U are at the end.</p>

    <p>Wait, what!?</p>

    <p>How are you feeling about this? Curious? Confused? Annoyed? Angry?

    <p>I wanted to talk about Gutenberg because I figured it would be new to
    most of you.  I wanted you to be the newcomer, to have a bunch of new things
    thrown at you, then to encounter something so odd that it seems almost
    intentionally perverse.  It's so easy to see how it could have been better.
    Why are J and U at the end? Why did they do this to us?</p>

    <p>In our technical conversations, there are moments like this all the time.
    It's hard to take in new information.  It's not clear which parts will be
    important later. Maybe that smoke test thing was just a nerd going on too
    long about something that fascinates him!</p>

    <p>Details get intricate.  Reasons can be obscure, or obscured.  When they
    are new to us, we have to accept them and deal with them, regardless of why
    they are the way they are.</p>

    <p>Just to close the loop on this: the reason J and U are at the end is that
    J and U weren't considered distinct letters in English until the mid-1600's.
    Until then they were just stylistic variants of I and V.  The layout of the
    upper case had been established and in use for 200 years by the time J and U
    were added to it.  So rather than disturb centuries of tradition, J and U
    were added at the end.</p>

    <p>And J and U remain at the end to this day, more than 300 years later!  If
    you visit a letterpress print shop today, you will see cases laid out like
    this.  Next time you want to whine about backward compatibility or legacy
    systems, these printers want to have a word with you!</p>

    very deep. Group dynamics, style differences, power balance, and lots of
    other factors will come into play. How do you decide who to talk to? What
    should you do if it just isn't working? How do you stop talking to someone?
    What about malicious people?  These are not easy questions. I don't have all
    the answers.</p>

    <p>What I hope I've done is convinced you that it's important to do well,
    and that it's a skill you can work on like any other.</p>

    <p>But doing it well is something to keep working at.</p>

    <p>Here's something advice for the next few days.</p>

    <p>After my first PyCon in 2007, I wrote a blog post summarizing the trip.
    It included this piece of advice: talk to people.  Everyone here is
    friendly, and they are here to meet you.  Don't be shy.  Talk to them!</p>

    <h1>What are we here for?</h1>
    <h1 class="incremental people">
        <span class="hangl">"</span>We are here to<br>
        help each other<br>
        get through this thing<span class="hangr">,</span><br>
        whatever it is.<span class="hangr">"</span>
    </h1>
</div>

<div class="text"><!-- {{{ -->

    <p>The writer Kurt Vonnegut asked his son Mark, who is also a writer, what
    are we here for, what's our purpose?  You know, the big question.  Mark
    neatly answered and side-stepped the question by saying, "We are here to
    help each other get through this thing, whatever it is."</p>

    <p>I think that's a great call to action: be good to each other. Listen to
    each other. Help each other.</p>
