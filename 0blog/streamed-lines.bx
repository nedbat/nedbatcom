<p>We've just switched from <a href='http://www.cvshome.org'>CVS</a>
to <a href='http://www.perforce.com'>Perforce</a> for source control at
work, and the Perforce docs pointed to an amazing paper about branching:
<a href="https://acme.bradapp.net/branching/">Streamed Lines: Branching Patterns for Parallel Software Development</a>.
</p>

<p>It is truly a catalog of patterns, but rather than being about
<a href='http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P0.htm'>architecture</a> or
<a href='http://home.earthlink.net/~huston2/dp/patterns.html'>software design</a>,
they are about how to branch (work simultaneously on more than one
release of software).
</p>

<p>It is a stunningly comprehensive paper, laying out 32 patterns
(eight each for elements, creation, policy and structuring), then
working through variations of a number of them, and ending with
traps and pitfalls (13 of them, including merge-a-phobia, branch-a-holic,
the never-ending branch, and codeline pudding).
I have not read it in depth, but am certain that there is much to learn
in it.
