<p><a href='http://www.256b.com/'>256b.com</a> is an archive of 256-byte executable
demos.  Yes: 256-byte executables.  These are actual Windows executables that draw
something interesting, and are only 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine how 256 bytes of compiled code can do anything significant,
but take a look at
<a href='http://www.256b.com/demo.php?demoId=225'>Tube</a>,
which produces a real-time dynamic pseudo-3D effect:</p>

</figurep>

<p>Another interesting entry is
<a href='http://www.256b.com/demo.php?demoId=195'>Self Disassembler</a>, which
disassembles its own code, and prints it to the screen.  This is a good example
of a <i>quine</i>, a program that when run prints its own text.
<a href='http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm'>The Quine Page</a> has a large number
of these programs.</p>

<p>Both 256-byte demos and quines are examples of geek challenges that twist
the rules of coding to get a particular effect,
much like the <a href='blog/200209.html#e20020902T110606'>polyglot programs</a>
I wrote about earlier this month.</p>
