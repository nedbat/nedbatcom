<p>Happy New Year everyone! I feel good.</p>

<more>

<p>I just raked up four bags of leaves.
The weather is very mild, so I was able to clean up outside enough
so that I won't have to shovel up leaves under snow, which drives me nuts.
</p>

<p>December turned out very well.  I had a major chunk of coding to do
at work, and set myself an unreasonably aggressive milestone for the
month as a challenge.
I didn't quite make it, but missing an unrealistic milestone
by a little bit amounts to a remarkable achievement, so I'm proud.
It was fun coding to do, I learned a lot, and I added good functionality
to the product.
</p>

<p>We had a good assortment of parties to attend this season, and saw
a lot of friends, old and new.</p>

<p>2003 overall was a good year:
