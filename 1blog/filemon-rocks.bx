<p>I haven't mentioned
<a href='http://www.sysinternals.com'>Sysinternals</a>
<a pref="0blog/sysinternals.bx">in a while</a>,
but they should be promoted forcefully and often.</p>

<p>Yesterday I wasted five hours trying to figure out why a C# module couldn't call a COM
interface.  The method was obviously properly defined, and called properly, but
it always raised a No Such Method exception.
I used oleview and ildasm and regasm until my eyes were crossed.
I cleaned and rebuilt. I rebooted.
Hours passed and I still could not figure out why it didn't work.
A handful of workers were similarly baffled after wasting more time.
</p>

<p>Finally we had the bright idea of using
<a href='http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/filemon.shtml'>Filemon</a> to monitor
exactly what files were being used by the process in question. Two minutes later,
it was clear that my local download assembly cache (WTF?) had a stale copy of the assembly.
I executed "gacutil /cdl" to clear the cache, and the problem was gone.</p>

<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you Sysinternals!</p>
