<p>I love the text-based web. I love that people can speak their minds, express
    opinions, encourage each other, and create a lively world of words. This
    also means they are free to design their text in, shall we say, expressive
    ways. Those ways are not always ideal for actually reading the words.</p>

<p>Today I really liked Tiberius Hefflin's
    <a href='https://www.unroutable.me/blog/2017/4/8/part-of-that-world'>Part of That World</a>,
    about the need to recognize non-code contributions in open source projects.
    You should read it, it is good and true.</p>

<p>But when I first got to the page, I saw this:</p>

<figurep>
    <img src="pix/that_world_1.png" alt="Screenshot of gray text on black background, slightly letterspaced" scale="0.5" />
</figurep>

<p>To start with the positive, this text has an elegance to it.  It gives a
    peaceful quiet impression.  It pairs perfectly with the mermaid
    illustration on the page.  But I find it hard to read. This typeface is too
    weak to be light-on-dark, and letterspacing is almost always a bad idea for
    body text. It isn't even white-on-black, it's 70% white on black, so the
    letters seem to be hiding in the dark.</p>

<p>I don't mean to pick on this page. It's a well-designed page.  There's
    clearly a mood being created here, and it's been established well. There
    are many pages online that veer much farther from the usual than this.</p>

<p>My solution for pages like this is a bookmarklet to strip away
    idiosyncrasies in text layout.  It changes text to almost-black on white,
    it removes letterspacing and shadows, and changes full-justified text to
    left-justified. When I use the bookmarklet on Part of That World, it looks
    like this:</p>

<figurep>
    <img src="pix/that_world_2.png" alt="Screenshot of cleaned-up text" scale="0.5" />
</figurep>

<p>You might prefer the original. That's fine, to each their own.  You might
    feel like the personality has been bleached from this text. To some extent,
    that's true. But I saw the original, and can choose between them. This helped
    me to read the words, and not get snagged on the design of the page.</p>

<p>This is the bookmarklet: <a href="javascript:(function(){var%20newSS=document.createElement('link'),styles=('*%20{%20background:%20#fff;%20color:%20#111;%20letter-spacing:%200;%20text-shadow:%20none;%20hyphens:%20none;}'+':link,%20:link%20*%20{%20color:%20#0000EE;%20}%20'+':visited,%20:visited%20*%20{%20color:%20#551A8B;%20}').replace(/;/g,'%20!important;');newSS.rel='stylesheet';newSS.href='data:text/css,'+escape(styles);document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(newSS);var%20els=document.getElementsByTagName('*');for(var%20i=0,el;el=els[i];i++){if(getComputedStyle(el).textAlign==='justify'){el.style.textAlign='left';}}})();">Clean text</a>.</p>

<p>This is the JavaScript code in the bookmarklet, formatted and tweaked so you
    can read it:</p>

<code lang="javascript"><![CDATA[
javascript:(function () {
    var newSS = document.createElement('link'),
        styles = (
            '* { ' +
                'background: #fff; color: #111; ' +
                'letter-spacing: 0; text-shadow: none; hyphens: none; ' +
            '}' +
            ':link, :link * { color: #0000EE; } ' +
            ':visited, :visited * { color: #551A8B; }'
        ).replace(/;/g,' !important;');
    newSS.rel = 'stylesheet';
    newSS.href = 'data:text/css,' + escape(styles);
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(newSS);
    var els = document.getElementsByTagName('*');
    for (var i = 0, el; el = els[i]; i++) {
        if (getComputedStyle(el).textAlign === 'justify') {
            el.style.textAlign = 'left';
        }
    }
})();
]]></code>

<p>There are other solutions to eccentrically designed pages.  You could read
    blogs in a single aggregating RSS reader.  But then everything is
    completely homogenized, and you don't even get a chance to experience the
    design as the author intended.  Writers could (and are) flocking to sites
    like Medium that again homogenize the design.</p>

<p>By the way, full disclosure: I don't like the design of my own site, the
    page you are (probably) currently reading.  I have been working on a
    re-design on and off for months.  Maybe eventually it will be finished. The
    text will be serif, and larger, with a responsive layout and fewer
    distractions. Some day.</p>
