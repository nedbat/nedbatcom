<p>I am starting a new job soon, at
<a href="https://anthropic.com">Anthropic</a>, the makers of the
<a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a> large language model.  I'll be
supporting researchers working to improve Claude's accuracy.</p>

<p>It will be an interesting change for me, for a few reasons.  First, I know
essentially nothing about how LLMs work and are built.  Second, it's my first
new job in almost 12 years.  Third, I've been "between gigs" for six months,
so I have to get back to a work-day routine.</p>

<p>I have very mixed feelings about the tsunami-like rise of AI in the tech
world and beyond.  It's clearly a very powerful tool, but it is also clearly
being used in some really dumb ways.  My primary concern is that it will be used
to make things worse in various ways: flooding Amazon with crappy e-books,
displacing human effort for "it's good enough" bot flods, spewing
disinformation chaff, and so on.  The energy needs are substantial as well,
which is a big problem.</p>

<p>But every technology can be used for good or ill.  Anthropic is a public
benefit corporation with safety as a central mission.  AI and LLMs aren't going
away, so maybe I can help Anthropic pull towards the good.</p>
