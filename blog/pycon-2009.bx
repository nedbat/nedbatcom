<title>PyCon 2009 notes</title>

<p>I had an amazing three days at PyCon 2009 in Chicago.  I won't have a coherent
write-up (at least not just yet), so these scattered notes will have to do:
</p>

<p>The weather was a great example of why not to hold conferences in Chicago:
cold, wet, even snowy.  Maybe next year we can hold PyCon someplace warm, like
Siberia (it will actually be in Atlanta). On the other hand, it was great to
be able to get on the Ell and be in the middle of a vibrant city.</p>

<p>Twitter was much bigger here this year than in the past, certainly for me.
It helped create a sense of a single hive mind, letting me keep up with the talks
I wasn't watching, and find out what was going on elsewhere.</p>

<p>I focused a lot of my time on testing topics, both because it's the thing I
need to learn more about for work, and because of my interest in providing tools
to other developers.  There was a huge amount of energy devoted to testing at this
PyCon.  The testing BoF on Saturday night was a combination frat party and lightning
talk session that went on until 11pm.</p>

<p>I gave two talks, on <a href='http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/26/'>coverage testing</a>
and <a href='http://nedbatchelder.com/text/whirlext.html'>C extensions</a>,
which I think went well, and seemed to be well received, so that was very gratifying.</p>

<p>I took note of good one-liners, newsworthy tidbits, and interesting
projects to follow-up on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Barry Hawkins on the Python community: we're like the Elves at Rivendell,
and hobbits show up and are impressed, and ask, "Why don't you tell more people
about this?", and Elves/Pythonistas respond, "Meh, we just do what we do."</li>

<li>Brett Cannon is making the choice of what DVCS to use for Python core
development.  He compared svn to prune-juice: the old standby, but not interesting
any more.  Git is out of the running, they will choose between Mercurial and Bazaar,
maybe as early as this week.</li>

<li>Jonathan Ellis lightninged on distributed databases, emphasizing
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/the-cassandra-project/'>Cassandra</a>,
which he claims does a good job on scalable writes, unlike many other solutions.</li>

<li><a href='http://jonathanscorner.com/'>Jonathan Hayward</a>: Asimov said,
"The most exciting phrase to hear in science is not "Eureka!" but, "that's funny.."</li>

<li><a href='http://getwindmill.com'>Windmill</a> deserves another look for
in-browser web app testing.  It looks really capable.</li>

<li>Mike Fletcher talked about his profiling visualizer called Run Snake Run,
which I saw a little of in the speaker prep room.  It looked very impressive,
but I didn't see his talk.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.kevbo.us/'>Kevin Boers</a> demonstrated his approach to
testing with <a href='http://twill.idyll.org/'>twill</a>.  He had a really
good approach, building up abstractions to get to a point where each web page
is represented in the tests by a class that can operate the page, and then building
scenarios up from there.  Unfortunately, twill won't help with Javascript applications,
so it's good for basic HTTP testing, but doesn't get to rich applications.</li>

<li>In his GUI testing talk, <a href='http://www.voidspace.org.uk/index2.shtml'>Michael Foord</a>
offered this quote: "If you write applications without tests then you are a bad person, incapable of love."
<emdash/>Wilson Bilkovich.</li>

<li>Catherine Devlin did a lightning talk showing off a very cool SQL tool that
lets you work with tabular SQL data as if it were Unix file data:
<a href='http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/2009/03/sqlpython-lightning-talk-follow-up.html'>sqlpython</a>.
</li>

<li><a href='http://code.google.com/p/playerpiano/'>playerpiano</a> is a tool for
better Python presentations. It runs doctests in an interactive Python session
so that you don't have to try to type code on stage.</li>

<li><a href='http://pymite.python-hosting.com/'>pymite</a> is a  micro-Python
(subset) for micro-controllers: it runs in 4Kb of RAM!</li>

<li><a href='http://www.web2py.com/'>web2py</a> is another web framework that
looks very slick, and was used to build the PyCon site.</li>

<li>DVDev is like Trac for Mercurial.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.openplans.org/projects/melkjug/project-home'>Melkjug</a>
is a tunable news reader.</li>

<li><a href='https://launchpad.net/txloadbalancer'>txLoadBalancer</a> is a
Twisted-based load balancer.</li>

<li>Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian from Reddit gave an entertaining keynote
discussing the history of Reddit and some of the interesting things they do now.
Reddit has been open-sourced, leading to some, shall we say, interesting clones.</li>

<li>Reddit is working on an open-source CSS compiler called C55 to provide
variables, nesting, and functions in CSS, just like what every procedural
programmer who writes CSS wants.</li>

<li>Reddit has an interesting thumbnailer that looks for the most interesting
square of pixels in an image, sometimes with humorous results.</li>

</ul>

<p>I met a lot of great people, some of whom I knew by name, some of whom were
new to me.  Both knew and new were great to meet face to face:
<a href='http://redsymbol.net/'>Aaron Maxwell</a>,
<a href='http://freshfoo.com/blog/'>Menno Smits</a>,
Ken Whitesell,
<a href='http://www.pirnat.com/'>Mike Pirnat</a>,
<a href='http://compoundthinking.com/blog/'>Mark Ramm</a>,
and Rand Batchelder (!).
</p>

<p>There was of course a lot of playfulness at PyCon,
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/termie/sets/72157616044454732/'>Beards of Python</a>
being my favorite (I was never a pony fan).</p>

<p>I'm already looking ahead to PyCon 2010 in Atlanta!</p>

Friday lightning talks

Barry Hawkins:

    - Pycon is like rivendell.  The elves have all this knowledge, doing cool
    stuff.  People: "Why don't you tell more people about it?"  Pythonistas:
    "Meh, we just do what we do."

Brett Cannon, DVCS for Python

    - SVN is the prune juice of vcs
    - git is out of the running
    - like to use a python-based tool

Jonathan Ellis

    - Cassandra distributed db.  Scalable writes

Jon Hayward? (jonathancorner.com)

    - Issac Asimov: the best sound in science isn't "Eureka," but "that's funny".
    - X-rays were an accidental discovery
    - Debugging is like this.

Windmill testing

    - Test recording in every browser.
    - Looks very capable
    - getwindmill.com

Twill Talk

    - stack:
        nose
        scenario objects
        order factory
        page objects
        twill

    - No javascript!
        - selenium

    - Page objects:
        - base class Page, derived classes for different Pages
        - web pages as objects with methods particular to them.

- ConfigObj is getting a lot of mention

Testing Ajax

    - modular design encourages testing.
    - ajax endpoints are simple, data-oriented.

    1. test data handlers
    2. test js
    3. isolate ui for testing
    4. automate ui tests
    5. gridify test suite

    javascriptlint.com

    rhino for running javascript standalone.
    No DOM, but env.js from resig may help.

    Fake controllers for feeding results to isolate the UI for testing.
    Bypass the server by replacing jQuery.ajax to mock out the entire server!
