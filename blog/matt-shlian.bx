<p>A random trip through Youtube deposited me at a video of a gorgeous flipbook called
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSrDnIVgVv0'>"cut out flipbook"</a>.
It's so simple and beautifully done. The creator, Matt Shlian, is a paper engineer and
artist, and his web page has the <a href='http://www.mattshlian.com/video%20frame1.html'>rest of his videos</a>,
which offer surprising and lovely paper creations.  As usual, I want how-to instructions!
