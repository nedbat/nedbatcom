<p><a href='http://www.acc.umu.se/~emilk/'>Phun</a> is a 2D physics simulator.
There seem to be a lot of these recently
(<a href='http://www.kloonigames.com/crayon/'>Crayon Physics</a>, for example),
I'm not sure why.
</p>

<p>But Phun lives up to its name, it is phun to play with, and comes with a few
sample scenes that are easy to fiddle around with and see what happens.  The
tower under attack by a catapult is especially good for experimentation.  I recommend
building a flimsy water tank on top of the tower for extra drama.</p>
