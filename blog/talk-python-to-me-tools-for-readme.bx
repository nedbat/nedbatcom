<p>Michael Kennedy invited me on his podcast to chat about a round-up of tools
for README maintenance and other similar project automation:
<a urlid="episode">Talk Python to Me #395: Tools for README.md Creation and
Maintenance</a>.</p>

<url id="episode" href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/395/tools-for-readme.md-creation-and-maintenance"/>

<p>We talked about almost 20 different tools, intermixed with philosophical
discussion about the problems maintainers face and the solutions they use.
Project maintainers need to write about their work, and present it to their
users.  How to do that in a way that is convenient for both the maintainer and
the user?  What to automate, and how?</p>

<p>Of course, I have opinions about this, which come out in the course of the
episode. Here are some of my top principles:</p>

<ul>

<li>Writing about your work helps you understand your work.</li>

<li>You need to write with your audience in mind, and "the same thing" may need
to be said multiple times, in different ways, for different audiences.</li>

<li>As much as possible, have a single source of truth, published to multiple
places as needed.</li>

<li>It's good to automate collecting information together for publishing,
but a human editing pass makes the result much better.</li>

</ul>

<p>It was a fun discussion.  Because we are both nerds caught up in the energy
of the moment, along the way we also touched on other topics like Twitter vs
Mastodon, ChatGPT and so on.  Give it a listen. I'm always interested to
hear about other approaches and tools.</p>
