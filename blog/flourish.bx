<p><a href="https://flourish.nedbat.com">Flourish</a> is a visual toy app that
draws harmonographs, sinuous curves simulating a multi-pendulum trace:

</figurep>

<p>Each harmonograph is determined by a few dozen parameter values, which are
chosen randomly. The number of parameters depends on the number of pendulums,
which defaults to 3.</p>

<p>Click a thumbnail to see a larger version.  The large-image pages have
thumbnails of "adjacent" images.  For each of the few dozen parameters, four
nearby values are substituted, giving four thumbnails for each parameter.
Clicking an adjacent thumbnail continues your exploration of the parameter
space:</p>

</figurep>

<p>The settings dialog lets you adjust the number of pendulums (which determines
the number of parameters) and the kinds of symmetry you are interested in.</p>

<p>I started this because I wanted to understand how the parameters affected the
outcome, but I was also interested to give it a purely visual design.  As an
engineer, it was tempting to present the values of the parameters
quantitatively, but I like the simplicity of just clicking curves you like.</p>

<p>I repeated a trick I've used in other
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/code/aptus/">mathy visual toys</a>: when
you download a PNG file of an image, the parameter values are stored in a data
island in the file.  You can re-upload the image, and Flourish will extract the
parameters and put you back into the parameter-space exploration at that
point.</p>

<p>This is one of those side projects that let me use different sorts of things
than I usually do: numpy, SVG, sass, Docker, and so on. I had more ideas for
things to add (there is color in the code but not the UI). Maybe someday I will
build them.</p>

<p>BTW, I am happy that my first post of 2021 is called "Flourish."  I hope it
is a harbinger of things to come.</p>
