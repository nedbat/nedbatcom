<p>Roger Alsing has made a fascinating image hack: reproduce an image with randomly-placed
translucent polygons:
<a href='http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/'>Genetic Programming: Evolution of Mona Lisa</a>.
At each step, a random polygon is placed on the image, and a simple image comparison
function determines whether a new proposed polygon makes it look more or less like the
goal image.  It's not fast, but the results are kind of startling.  A photo of me and a friend:

<figurep>
    <img src='pix/mattned.jpg' alt='Matt and Ned'/>
</figurep>

<p>And a polygonal reproduction with 108 polygons:</p>

<figurep>
    <img src='pix/mattned_evolved.jpg' alt='Matt and Ned evolved with polygons'/>
</figurep>

<p>This reminds me a little of the <a href='blog/200805/css_homer_animated.html'>CSS Homer</a>,
recreating an image by amassing unlikely components in just the right way.
BTW: the comments on Roger's post contain a number of AI nerds debating whether
this is truly genetic programming, and if so what kind, or if it is simply a
hill-climbing algorithm.  In any case, it's very cool.
