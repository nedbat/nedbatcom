<p><a href='http://www.chaoscope.org'>Chaoscope</a> is a visualization toy.
It draws beautiful pictures of strange attractors, which are a bizarre fractal-like
mathematical construct from the field of chaos theory.  Whatever, they look really
nice:

<p>The interface is really well done, letting you randomly find interesting
attractors, but then drag them in three dimensions and fiddle with their parameters.
You can get a good intuitive sense of the chaos in chaos theory by making small
changes in the parameters, and seeing sometimes small changes in the output,
and sometimes huge changes.  There are a number of nice options for the rendering
phase too.</p>

<p>This is definitely going in my list of mesmerizing desktop toys...</p>
