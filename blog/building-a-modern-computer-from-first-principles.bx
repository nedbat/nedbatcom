<p>This looks like an amazing textbook:
<a href='http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/'>Build a Modern Computer from First Principles</a>.
Judging from the accompanying presentation
(<a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/talks/TECS%20course%20&amp;%20book%20overview.pps">From Nand to Tetris in 12 Steps</a>),
it presents a wild ride up the entire computing stack, from nand gates to operating systems.
The authors provide a series of Java-based emulators (hardware, CPU, VM),
translators (assembler, compiler), and a primitive programming language and operating
system with which to do the 12 projects.
I'm not sure how much depth they can provide at their fast pace, but it sure would be interesting
to try it.
