<p>More thoughts about AI and LLMs.
</p>

<ul>

<li>LLMs are better at writing new code than at finding and adapting old code.</li>

<li>Harm: pollution of the info ecosystem. how will ai not train itself on ai slop?</li>

<li>aggressive defense against ai scraping: needless effort, and makes ai worse.</li>

<li>Plato felt that writing would prevent people from learning: https://fs.blog/an-old-argument-against-writing/
Perhaps we won't go as deep, but we will be able to go broader? idk!
</li>

<li>Steve Yegge's post. https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer
Devs will become managers of AIs and code-reviewers.</li>

<li>"I like writing code": work will split into factory vs artisinal.</li>

</ul>
