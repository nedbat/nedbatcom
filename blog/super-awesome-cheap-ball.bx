<title>Super awesome cheap ball</title>

<p>On a road trip a few months back, we stopped at a gas station on the Mass Pike
(the Massachusetts Turnpike for you out-of-staters), and were just idly looking
over the cheap junk they had for sale there.  A interestingly geometric ball
caught my eye.  It was green, and had a strange structure that seemed like it
would move in some way.  I tried pulling gently at its panels but nothing happened.

<p>Then I tossed it lightly and caught it: now it was orange!  Look:</p>

<p>Even after you've tried it a few times, it's still a bit startling to see
a sphere turn inside out and still be a sphere.</p>

<p>This ball entertained us for the whole weekend, and since it had only cost
me $4 at a gas station, we dubbed it Super Awesome Cheap Ball, in homage to

<p>A later stop at the gas station unearthed the name of the ball, and its creator:

by Chuck Hoberman, the creator of the familiar
