<p>At the last <a href='http://python.meetup.com/181/'>Python meetup</a>, the
presenter was going to talk about a concept (let's call it the XYZ pattern),
and he wanted to make sure everyone understood the concept before he did.
He did it in a common way, by saying,
</p>

<quote><p>Does anyone here not know what XYZ is?</p></quote>

<p>This is the wrong way to do it.</p>

<p>When you ask a question like this of your audience, you get an uncomfortable
pause.  Your listeners now have to gauge their own knowledge:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The ones who have no idea what XYZ is will wonder if they'll look stupid
    for raising their hand.</li>

    <li>The ones who have a vague idea will wonder if they need to know more,
    or if they can skate by.</li>

    <li>Half the ones who are confident that they know what XYZ is actually
    have it a little wrong, but won't realize that they have a different conception
    than the speaker intended.</li>
</ul>

<p>The talk will stop for a moment while people decide what to do.  If someone
asks for an explanation, the presenter will spend a little time explaining it.
If no one does, the presenter might actually explain it a little bit anyway,
because he was prepared to. Momentum has been lost and people feel awkward.</p>

<p>The better way to do this is to say,</p>

<quote><p>As I'm sure I don't have to remind you, the XYZ pattern is a common
way to mumble the frabbitz in systems with more than three quuxers.  It's good
because it separates the concerns about sculpting and shading.</p></quote>

<p>In less time than it took to poll and embarrass the audience, you've:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Complimented your listeners about already knowing what XYZ is.</li>
    <li>Defined XYZ, so those that didn't know now do.</li>
    <li>Explained your view of XYZ, so that even those that did know it now have
    your take on it as a common starting point for the rest of the talk.</li>
</ul>
