<p>One of those simple typos that turns into an embarrassing public mistake:
<a href='http://blog.dotsmart.net/2008/09/25/cisco-home-page-fail/'>Cisco home page FAIL</a>,
where (it is theorized) a regex that should have had \t had only t, and as a
result, all lowercase t's were removed from the page, breaking it completely.
