<p>Serge Bondar did a controlled experiment to see how much text on a page
matters to the big three search engines.  He created very long pages with
unique made-up words inserted into them at regular intervals.  Then he
watched the server logs to see how much data the search engines actually
pulled down.  Then he waited for his unique marker words to turn up in
search results.</p>

<p>He found that Yahoo only cares about the first 210Kb, Google gets bored
after 520Kb, and MSN persists through 1.1Mb.  Read about the entire
experiment:

</p>

<p>When I read the results, I worried because my blog archives are organized
into monthly pages.  I thought maybe they were long enough that some content
wasn't getting indexed properly.  Turns out, no need to worry.
My longest archive page is
<a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20060513174525/https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200311.html'>November 2003</a>, at 119Kb.
My <a href='blog/archive/all.html'>complete archive listing</a> is longer,
just at Yahoo's limit of 210Kb, but that I prevent that page from being
indexed anyway, since it is just a long list of post titles.
