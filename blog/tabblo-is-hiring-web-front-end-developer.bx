<p>Tabblo is looking for a web front-end developer, an HTML guru who
can turn mock-ups into functioning web pages, isn't afraid of Javascript, has
dealt with the dynamic nature of web 2.0 applications, and can function in a
(clich√© alert) dynamic, fast-paced environment.
</p>

<p>Tabblo, a part of Hewlett-Packard, is the group that built <a href='http://www.tabblo.com'>Tabblo.com</a>,
but has also created a half-dozen other web experiences exploring the boundaries
between online and offline content.  It's a fun group doing fun things.</p>

<p>Here's a link to a <a href='https://hp.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobdetail.ftl?job=1643123'>full job posting</a>.
If you apply, drop me a line to let me know...</p>
