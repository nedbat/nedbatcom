<p>Two good things in the Python testing world intersected this week.</p>

<p>Harry Percival wrote a great book called <a href='http://obeythetestinggoat.com/'>Test-Driven Development with Python</a>.
    I should have written about it long ago.  It's a step-by-step example of
    building real software (Django web applications) using Test-Driven Development.</p>

<p>Harry describes the philosophy, the methods, and the steps, of doing real
    TDD with Django. Even if you aren't using Django, this book shows the way
    to use TDD for serious projects.  I'm not yet a TDD convert, but it was
    very helpful to see it in action and understand more about it.</p>

<p>The entire book is available to read online if you like. Taking the meta to
    a whole new level, Harry also has
    <a href='https://github.com/hjwp/Book-TDD-Web-Dev-Python'>the source for
    the book, including tests</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>Brian Okken has been running a podcast devoted to Python testing, called 
    <a href='http://pythontesting.net/test-podcast/'>Python Test Podcast</a>.</p>

<p>His latest episode is 
    <a href='http://pythontesting.net/podcast/harry-percival-pt009/'>an interview with Harry</a>.
    People must have thought I was nuts driving to work the other day, I was
    nodding so much.  It was a good conversation.  Highly recommended.</p>
