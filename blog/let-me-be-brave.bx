<p>My wife Susan has an op-ed in today's Washington Post:
<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10932-2005Jan14.html'>Let Me Be Brave</a>,
about Special Olympics and the death of Rosemary Kennedy (which I wrote about here last weekend).
Of course, she says it all better than I could...
