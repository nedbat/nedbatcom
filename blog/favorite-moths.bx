<p><a href='https://themoth.org/'>The Moth</a> is a story-telling podcast.
I've been listening to it for a long time.  I don't like all the stories, but
when I hear one that I do, I really like sharing it with my family.  Maybe more
than they like me sharing it, but I still try to encourage them to listen to the
ones I find for them.</p>

<p>I like stories that are funny but also touching.  These are some of my favorites:</p>
