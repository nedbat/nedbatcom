<p>The Freenode IRC network (and I guess others) are under an aggressive spam
    attack these days.  I've learned a lot more about Freenode modes in order
    to help defend against the spam.  This is my understanding of the tools
    and techniques.  Corrections welcomed!</p>

<p>IRC is a great way to connect with other people, but it is arcane and poorly
    documented.  How IRC networks are configured and maintained is not standardized.
    The details here are for Freenode. I have no idea how much of this applies
    to other networks.</p>

<p>When a user connects to Freenode, they can use a registered nick (nickname),
    or an unregistered one.  Registering is also called "identifying with
    services," meaning you have presented your password to the IRC service.
    Here's how to register your nick if you haven't yet:
    <a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration">Nickname Registration</a>.
    The spam bot constantly changes nicks, but doesn't use registered nicks, so
    the defense is all based on preventing what unregistered nicks can do.</p>

<p>The main concept for configuring IRC is "modes".  These are single-letter
    flags that can be applied to users and channels.  The modes are different
    for each:
    <a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/usermodes">User Modes</a>, and
    <a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/channelmodes">Channel Modes</a>.
</p>

<p>The modes you can set depend on whether you are a channel operator, or just
    a regular user.</p>

<p><b>For regular users:</b> the spam bot will send you private messages unless
    you give yourself the +R mode, which means that only registered nicks can
    send you private messages.  To apply this to yourself, use this command in
    your IRC client (replace "your_nick" with your nick):</p>

<code><![CDATA[
# Stop unregistered nicks from PMing me
/mode your_nick +R
# What are my current modes?
/mode your_nick
]]></code>

<p><b>For channel operators:</b> you have a few options for how to defend your
    channel.  I think the first option is the best.</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can allow unregistered nicks to join, but prevent them from speaking
    with +q.  This flag takes an argument which is the pattern of user to quiet.
    "$~a" means anyone who is unregistered:</li>
<code><![CDATA[
# Unregistered nicks will be quieted in #your_channel
/mode #your_channel +q $~a
# See the list of quieted user patterns
/mode #your_channel +q
]]></code>

    <li>If you use +q, but have unregistered bots that you want to be able to talk in your
    channel, you can exempt them with +e:</li>
<code><![CDATA[
# Your bot will be able to talk
/mode #your_channel +e $a:your_bot_nick
# See the list of exempted user patterns
/mode #your_channel +e
]]></code>

    <li>You can completely prevent unregistered nicks from joining your channel with +r:</li>
<code><![CDATA[
# Only registered nicks can join #your_channel
/mode #your_channel +r
# See the list of channel modes
/mode #your_channel
]]></code>

    <li>If for whatever reason you cannot stop unregistered nicks from talking
        in your channel, then you will get spam messages.  You can still help
        defend by inviting freenode's Sigyn bot into your channel.  The bot
        kills spammers when they send their first message.  Invite it like this:</li>

<code><![CDATA[
# Invite the freenode spam fighting bot
/invite Sigyn #your_channel
]]></code>
</ul>
