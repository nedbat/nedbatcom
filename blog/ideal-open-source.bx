<title>Ideal open source</title>
<category>opensource</category>

<description>DHH says we can choose our purpose in open source. I don't feel all
the freedom he describes.</description>

<body>

<p>A friend asked my opinion about DHH's essay from last year:
<a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-won-t-let-you-pay-me-for-my-open-source-d7cf4568">I won't let you pay me for my open source</a>.
</p>

<p>He makes some interesting points about how Bill Gates and Richard Stallman,
the poster children for capitalism and open source, normally considered polar
opposites, are actually driven by the same economic fears of scarcity.  Gates'
fear is that people will use software without paying, Stallman's fear is that
they won't contribute.</p>

<p>But then he moves into his ideal view of open source, which is that it can be
completely removed from these economic fears and constraints, because there is
no scarcity.  If I write software, and you use it without paying or
contributing, I am not harmed.  And your actions also don't harm other users who
might pay or contribute. So there's no scarcity!</p>

<p>He goes on to celebrate writing software as a form of self-actualization.
Creating something for the pure joy of creation, with no expectation of anything
in return. He touches on autonomy, mastery, and purpose as three pillars of
motivation to act.</p>

<p>I totally understand this view. I write side projects. I like that I can
choose what to write and how to write it (autonomy).  I learn while writing, and
enjoy learning (mastery).  And I can decide for each project why I'm writing it
(purpose).</p>

<p>DHH eventually gets to the core of his philosophical outlook:</p>

<quote><p>There is no universal meaning to life. Youâ€™ve been thrown into the
world without a preordained purpose, which is both a terrible burden to bear and
the ultimate freedom to embrace. You get to decide.</p></quote>

<p>Do I get to decide? In some sense, yes, but actually, I can only choose among
the options available to me.</p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>I want to work on a side-project full-time!</i></b><br/>
Oops, no, that's not a choice, because I have to pay for food and shelter.</li>

<li><b><i>I have a day job, but want to have time and energy to maintain a project!</i></b>
<br/> Reality: I'm tired after a full day of work, and my family
needs me, and there are other chores to do.</li>

</ul>

<p>To get back to purpose: my ideal for open source is that I write something
useful, and other people like it and use it. The more people the better.</p>

<p>I'm lucky, because I've managed that:
<a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io">coverage.py</a> is widely used, and
I am known because of it.  But there's a downside:
<a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/">221 open issues</a>,
many of which are complex, or vague, or require difficult decisions.</p>

<p>This idea that I can decide my purpose feels a bit like a genie granting me a
wish, and then I have to deal with the unanticipated plot twists that
result.</p>

<p>A project like coverage.py can eventually become a lot of difficult
time-consuming not-fun work.  It's true, I am not obligated to continue working
on it, or to answer those issues. But that wouldn't fulfill the purpose I was
aiming for.  I didn't start a project so that I could abandon it when lots of
people are using it.  I didn't start a project so that I could ignore the
problems people are having.  I don't get to decide my purpose. I can only choose
among the options that reality offers to me.</p>

<p>Nadia Eghbal Asparouhova studied open source and understood that there is
scarcity: a scarcity of maintainer attention. (If you want to read more, she
wrote a book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in
Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a>, and also a Ford
Foundation research report:
<a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">Roads
and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure</a>.)</p>

<p>When open source maintainers complain that big companies use their software
without providing support, DHH is right: there was no transaction promised. He's
right that there's a kind of freedom to avoiding those transactions.</p>

<p>I think what drives that negative tension between maintainers and
"freeloading" users is that missing possibility: there's a conceivable reality
where the maintainers' open source ideal situations are achievable.  Support
commensurate with use would let maintainers focus on their projects.  Not only
would this make maintainers' realities better match their desires, it would make
for better software, which would help everyone.</p>

<p>I've written before about corporations and open source:
<a pref="blog/corporations-and-open-source-why-and-how.bx"/>.  I understand
how companies work: they won't pay for something if they don't have to.  Why are
we as a society OK with this?  Suppose someone said, "I never tip waiters, why
should I? I don't get anything extra by doing it, and my kids should have that
money."  Where I am from, people would be horrified by this attitude.</p>

<p>But companies' standard operating style is exactly that: "I can get that
software free, nothing is requiring me to pay for it, so why should I?" We all
shrug and expect nothing different.  But why not expect something different?
Companies are just large collections of people. Why is it acceptable for a
company to act so differently than each of its component people
individually?</p>

<p>As an open source maintainer, it feels like my ideal situation is just on the
other side of a locked fence, and I can't get it.  Corporate support could make
that a reality, but no one expects it, so it doesn't happen.</p>
