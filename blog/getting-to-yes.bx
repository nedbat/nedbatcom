<title>Getting to Yes</title>
<body>

    <p>I've long been interested in how people communicate, and also in how to teach.
        Lately I've been spending time in the <a href='irc://irc.libera.chat/#python'>#python</a>
        IRC channel, and it's an interesting place to observe and experiment.
    </p>

    <p>IRC is a really difficult medium:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is purely textual, so there are no social cues to help lubricate communication.</li>
        <li>Brevity is valued, so lots of things people usually say to keep the conversation "polite" are skipped.</li>
        <li>The discussions are about detailed technical topics, and agreement on fine distinctions can be difficult to reach.</li>
        <li>The participants tend to be strangers to each other so there's little common ground to build on.</li>
        <li>People join in from around the world, including those with poor English skills.</li>
        <li>The participants are at wildly varying levels of expertise, so it is difficult to know what is already understood and what is not.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When people come into #python with a question, things don't always go smoothly.  I have lots of ideas about
        why that is, and how to improve the situation, but I want to mention just one today: say "Yes" more.</p>

    <p>Here's an actual interaction from a few days ago, nicks have been changed:</p>

<raj> also, "if not x" checks if x == none?
<raj> None
<asdf`> raj, no, checks if bool(x) == False
<asdf`> raj, and yeah, that's bool(None), bool(0), '', [] etc.
<raj> ohh, very interesting
<raj> thank you
<nedbat> raj: yes:  "not x"  will be true for None, and False, and 0, and "", etc.
