<description>Two geometric facts about 63, but how to connect them?</description>

<p>63 is a <a urlid="octnum">centered octahedral number</a>. That means if you
build an approximation of an octahedron with cubes, one size of octahedron will
have 63 cubes.</p>

<p>In the late 1700's <a urlid="hauy">René Just Haüy</a> developed a theory
about how crystals formed: successive layers of fundamental primitives in
orderly arrangements.  One of those arrangements was stacking cubes together to
make an octahedron.</p>

<p>Start with one cube:</p>

</figurep>

<p>Add six more cubes around it, one on each face. Now we have seven:</p>

</figurep>

<p>Add another layer, adding a cube to touch each visible cube, making 25:</p>

</figurep>

<p>One more layer and we have a total of 63:</p>

</figurep>

<p>The remaining numbers in <a href="https://oeis.org/A001845">the sequence</a>
less than 10,000 are 129, 231, 377, 575, 833, 1159, 1561, 2047, 2625, 3303,
4089, 4991, 6017, 7175, 8473, 9919.</p>

<p>63 also shows up in the <a urlid="delannoy">Delannoy numbers</a>: the
number of ways to traverse a grid from the lower left corner to upper right
using only steps north, east, or northeast.  Here are the 63 ways of moving on a
3<times/>3 grid:</p>

<p>(Diagram from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Delannoy3x3.svg">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>In fact, the number of cubes in a Haüy octahedron with N layers is the same
as the number of Delannoy steps on a 3<times/>N grid!</p>

<p>Since the two ideas are both geometric and fairly simple, I would love to
find a geometric explanation for the correspondence.  The octahedron is
three-dimensional, and the Delannoy grids have that tantalizing 3 in them.  It
seems like there should be a way to convert Haüy coordinates to Delannoy
coordinates to show how they relate.  But I haven't found one...</p>

<bulletsep/>

<p>Colophon: I made the octahedron diagrams by asking Claude to write a
<a href="code/diagrams/hauy/hauy_oct.py">Python program</a> to do it.
It wasn't a fast process because it took pushing and prodding to get the
diagrams to come out the way I liked.  But Claude was very competent, and I
could think about the results rather than about projections or color spaces.  I
could dip into it for 10 minutes at a time over a number of days without having
to somehow reconstruct a mental context.</p>

<p>This kind of casual hobby programming is perfect for AI assistance.  I don't
need the code to be perfect or even good, I just want the diagrams to be nice.
I don't have the focus time to learn how to write the program, so I can leave it
to an imperfect assistant.</p>
