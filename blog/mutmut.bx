<p>Mutation testing is an old idea that I haven't yet seen work out, but it's
fascinating.  The idea is that your test suite should catch any bugs in your
code, so what if we artificially insert bugs into the code, and see if the test
suite catches them?</p>

<p>Mutation testers modify (mutate) your project code in small ways, then run
your test suite. If the tests all pass, then that mutation is considered a
problem: a bug that your tests didn't catch.  The theory is that a mutation
will change the behavior of your program, so if your test suite is testing
closely enough, some test should fail for each mutation.  If a mutation doesn't
produce a test failure, then you need to add to your tests.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with this plan.  The first is that it is
time-consuming.  Most people feel like it takes too long to run their entire
test suite just once. Mutation testers run the whole suite once for each
mutation, and there can be thousands of mutations.</p>

<p>But my larger concern is false positives: not all mutations are bugs, and if
the mutation tester reports too many non-bugs as bugs, then its usefulness is
diminished or even negated.  I wanted to examine this idea more closely.</p>

<p>There are a few mutation testers out there for Python. I thought I would
give them a try, starting with <a href='https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>mutmut</a>.</p>

<p>I needed a test suite to use, so I created a slightly artificial project.
The templite module in coverage.py is almost standalone, and is well-tested.
And it's small enough that its test suite runs in less than a second.
I extracted templite, wrote some project scaffolding, and gave it its
<a href="https://github.com/nedbat/templite">own repository</a>.</p>

<p>Now I had a project that tested well:</p>

<code><![CDATA[

]]></code>

<p>(The one line missing coverage is a conditional for Python 2 vs
Python 3.)</p>

<p>Running mutmut was easy:</p>

<code><![CDATA[
$ pip install mutmut
Collecting mutmut
...
Installing collected packages: mutmut
Successfully installed mutmut-1.3.1

$ mutmut run

- Mutation testing starting -

These are the steps:
1. A full test suite run will be made to make sure we
   can run the tests successfully and we know how long
   it takes (to detect infinite loops for example)
2. Mutants will be generated and checked

Mutants are written to the cache in the .mutmut-cache
directory. Print found mutants with `mutmut results`.

Legend for output:
🎉 Killed mutants. The goal is for everything to end up in this bucket.
⏰ Timeout. Test suite took 10 times as long as the baseline so were killed.
🤔 Suspicious. Tests took a long time, but not long enough to be fatal.
🙁 Survived. This means your tests needs to be expanded.

mutmut cache is out of date, clearing it...
1. Running tests without mutations
⠇ Running... Done

2. Checking mutants
⠧ 154/154  🎉 146  ⏰ 0  🤔 0  🙁 8
]]></code>

<p>This ran 154 different mutations, which took about a minute for my
half-second-ish test suite.  146 of them resulted in test suite failures, as
they should.   But 8 passed the test suite, so they have to be examined as
potential test gaps.</p>

<p>One nice touch: if you interrupt mutmut, when you run it again, it picks up
where it left off, which is great for a long-running process like this.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how mutmut decides where to find the code to mutate.  In this
case it found it implicitly.  Other projects I tried, I had to add some
configuration to setup.cfg, even though I thought the projects were laid out
similarly.</p>

<p>To look at the mutants, use the <codeword>results</codeword> command:</p>

<code><![CDATA[
$ mutmut results
To apply a mutant on disk:
    mutmut apply <id>

To show a mutant:
    mutmut show <id>


Survived 🙁 (8)

<p>This gives me the ids of the mutants that survived, that is, the mutations
that didn't cause a failure in the test suite.</p>

<p>We can see the actual code mutation with the <codeword>show</codeword>
command:</p>

]]></code>

<p>Right off the bat, we have a philosophical decision to make.  A bit about
how templite works: it converts template files into Python code.  Rendering a
template is done by executing the generated Python code.  This
<codeword>INDENT_STEP</codeword> constant is the indentation amount used in the
generated code.</p>

<p>I have no tests that examine the generated code. That code is an
implementation detail.  The important thing is that the templates render
properly, so that is what's tested.  When mutmut changed the indent level to 5,
the generated code was different, but only in white space, so it ran the same,
and still produced the right output.</p>

<p>Does this mutation point to a problem in the test suite? I don't think I
should test that the indentation level in the generated code is 4 spaces.
Mutmut provides a way to mark the line to exempt it from mutation, but I'm not
sure I want to start adding those pragmas. This is one of the things I wanted
to understand: what kind of false positives would appear, and how would I deal
with them?</p>

<p>Let's see how the next mutant looks:</p>

<p>The second mutant has found the one line of code that is not covered by the
test suite, because it's for Python 2, and we are only running under Python 3.
Mutmut has a <codeword>--use-coverage</codeword> flag, which uses coverage data
to skip mutations on lines that are not covered by the test suite. If I had
used it to begin with, this mutant wouldn't have appeared. Nice.</p>

<p>Next:</p>

<p>This is a classic false positive.  The condition has been changed from
greater to greater-or-equal, but it doesn't change the behavior of the code.
This mutation is in an "elif" clause and the equal case was already handled by
the previous if clause, so greater-or-equal is the same as greater.</p>

<p>Mutant 45 gives us our first true success:</p>

<p>Templite can squash white space around tokens, and here we are changing the
initial value of the "should I squash white space?" flag.  How can it not cause
a test failure?  Because we never tested a template that started with white
space!  Adding this simple test kills the mutant:</p>

<p>I thought that <codeword>mutmut run</codeword> again would clear the mutant
from the results, but the only way I could find to clear it was to delete the
mutmut cache and run all the mutations again.</p>

<p>Mutant 46 is another false positive:</p>

<p>Here <codeword>squash</codeword> is the same boolean flag we saw in mutant
45.  I only ever check it with <codeword>if squash:</codeword>, so of course
False and None produce the same results.  Notice here if I wanted to prevent
this mutant by adding a pragma to the line, I would also have prevented the
first success we had.  Adding that pragma would be counter-productive.</p>

<p>This is another useful result.  Turns out in my tests, I always wrote
space-squashing tags with a space, like <codeword>{{a -}}</codeword>.  This
mutated code adjusted the trimming of punctuation to account for the dash.
Because I always had a space before the dash, the change to -4 went unnoticed.
I killed this mutant by changing some tags in my tests to have no space:
<codeword>{{a-}}</codeword>, and also added some with many spaces for good
measure.</p>

<p>Mutant 108 sure looks like it's real:</p>

somewhere in the actual error message. If mutmut had added chaff in the middle

<p>This mutant survived because this file was never executed.  That in itself
was a useful clue to the fact that I had made a useless file.  Delete the file,
and the mutant is killed. (BTW: <a href='https://github.com/boxed/mutmut/issues/52#event-2173624536'>mutmut has changed</a>
so that it won't create this mutation any more.)</p>

<p>So after all this, how did mutmut do?  It gave me seven mutations, four of
which resulted in improving the tests.  That's not a bad outcome.  But I don't
know how I would use this regularly.  I don't have a good way to silence the
three false positives, so if I run mutmut again in the future, I will have to
consider them again.</p>

<p>As another data point about the cost of mutation testing, I tried mutmut on
<a href='https://github.com/edx/edx-lint'>another project</a> with a 10-second
test suite.  It took mutmut 43 minutes to run 513 mutants, of which 165
survived.  I haven't looked through them yet to see what they mean.</p>

<p>All in all, I am pleased with the results.  As an occasional (but expensive)
way to assess your test suite, mutmut works well.</p>
