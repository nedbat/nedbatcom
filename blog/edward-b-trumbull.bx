<p>I'm known as Ned, but my legal name is Edward.  Both of my grandfathers were
named Edward, so I was named Edward.  But my mom didn't want me to be called
Eddie, so I've been Ned from day one.</p>

<p>My father's father was named Edward because he was named after his mother's
father (his grandfather, my great-great-grandfather): Edward B. Trumbull,
described as the last of the foreign-trade sea captains sailing from Salem
Massachussetts:</p>
