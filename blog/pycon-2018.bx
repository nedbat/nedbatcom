<p>PyCon 2018 is over, and of course I enjoyed the hell out of it.  I tweeted a
bit this year, so I'll tell the story partly with tweets.</p>

<p>I did a talk about Big-O notation: <a pref='text/bigo.px'/>.  People seemed
to like it.  I was especially gratified when people told me that the "sitting
at the adult table" comment exactly described them, and the talk helped.
Nice.</p>

<p>I planned on a juggling open space this year, and brought equipment for it.
Getting it through airport security was fun:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">TSA swabbed all 18 of my juggling beanbags. When I mentioned the clubs, the TSA guy picked one up and said, ‚ÄúIf you can take down a plane with one of these, more power to you.‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pycon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pycon2018</a></p>‚Äî Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/994554068914798592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>And everyone has a wise-crack:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I told my wife I was bringing 18 beanbags for a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pycon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pycon2018</a> juggling open-space, she said, ‚ÄúGood thing it‚Äôs not a bowling open-space!‚Äù  Friday 7pm, room 9. ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>‚Äî Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/994929903144488962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>Eric Holscher proposed a rule of thumb: if this is your Nth PyCon, then you
have to meet N new people every day. My strategy was at breakfast and lunch,
when wandering around looking for a table to sit at, choose one with no one I
know, and with people that don't look like me.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">/me wonders whether he is meeting his quota of 11 new people each day at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pycon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pycon2018</a>‚Ä¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/comesayhi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#comesayhi</a></p>‚Äî Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/994935989889060864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>Hillel Wayne did a great talk about
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYucYon2-lk'>advanced testing with Hypothesis and contracts</a>,
but he also excelled in a different way:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazing. <a href="https://twitter.com/Hillelogram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hillelogram</a> passes out homemade granola bars because his talk is just before lunch. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pycon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pycon2018</a></p>‚Äî Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/994974183724666880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>One goof by the program committee this year: it seemed like often same-topic
talks were scheduled in the same time slot. There were four testing talks all
scheduled at the same time.  One was by Justin Crown
(<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDdUuoI_lIg'>"WHAT IS THIS MESS?" ‚Äî Writing tests for pre-existing code bases</a>),
who I met in the hallway:</p>

<p>The juggling open space was great, a lot (15?) of people showed up,
including <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRvTeK5Ndq8'>Christy Heaton</a>
who I had met that morning at breakfast.  We threw things all over the
place:</p>

<p>One of the interesting experiences at PyCon is finally meeting face-to-face
with people that you've built a strong online-only friendship with, like
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI'>Mariatta Wijaya</a>.</p>

<p>It's fun to be captured by Kenneth Reitz, but maybe not outside where it's
windy?</p>

<p>David Beazley <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ9z6Ge-vXs'>showed off</a>
how to use the latest meta-programming tools in Python 3.6 to implement a
parser generator:</p>

<p>Ying Li's keynote was a masterful explanation of
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ0vibC_Hl0&amp;t=2107s'>web security as told through a children's book</a>.
Then Qumisha Goss (who I met at breakfast!) did a
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ0vibC_Hl0&amp;t=4050s'>great keynote about teaching
urban kids programming at a public library</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great quote from Q Goss at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyCon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PyCon2018</a>: No one has ever become less great by helping someone else become great.</p>‚Äî Gre7g Luterman (@Gre7gL) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gre7gL/status/995301519107993605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>Another day we had an impromptu juggling session, helped along by
penny-whistle accompaniment by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRp84BlFF94'>Justin Myles Holmes</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Even better than a planned juggling open space: an unplanned one! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pycon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pycon2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/dI1AMBpNTC">pic.twitter.com/dI1AMBpNTC</a></p>‚Äî Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/995776185341751297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>Turns out this is conference chair Ernest Durbin's car:</p>

<p>PyCon did a great job including everyone.  At registration, you could choose
a ribbon to attach to your badge that announced your preferred pronouns.
Also:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div class="inner"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only did <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pycon2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pycon2018</a> set aside a room for people to make mom-calls on Mother‚Äôs Day, but the room had dedicated networking so that video chats would work well!  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#amazing</a></p>‚Äî Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/996023091334668288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2018</a></div></blockquote>

<p>I hung around for one day of sprints, which I used mostly to talk with
people. Trying to help pylint with an installation issue, I was introduced to
check-manifest. Where has it been all my life?</p>

<p>If you are looking for videos to watch, in addition to the ones linked
above, take a look at these:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww1UsGZV8fQ'>Lisa Roach: Demystifying the Patch Function</a>.</li>

<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSSpnq362Bk'>James Bennett: A Bit about Bytes: Understanding Python Bytecode</a>.</li>

<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuuYwUxM-ZY'>Allison Kaptur: Love Your Bugs</a>.</li>

<li>Lightning talks are always great, but this year the
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzFWz5fiVKU'>Sunday morning lightning talks</a>
also featured a masterful telling of an extended shaggy-dog joke by Harry
Percival in the interstices between the talks.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's kind of dissatisfying writing about PyCon, because it's hard to include
everything that happened.  It doesn't feel like a technical conference, it
feels like a family reunion.  I belong to a few different sub-communities and I
kept shifting from one to the next: Boston people, ex-Boston people, jugglers,
testing geeks, IRC people, meetup organizers, open source developers, and so on.</p>

<p>And I'm sure I've forgotten about some amazing piece of the four days. If it
was with you, I'm sorry!</p>

<p>It's always a great place to find your tribe, re-energize, cement old friendships,
make new ones, learn, teach, and have fun.  Next year in Cleveland!</p>
