<p>Continuous integration is a great idea: you configure a server to periodically
pull your source code, build it, run the tests, run lint, measure coverage, and
so on.  Then it graphs everything, stores the results for examination, and so on.
</p>

<p>I'd been trying to figure out how to use the
<a href='https://hudson.dev.java.net/'>Hudson</a> CI server with Python, and the
few times I tried to get my mind around it, it just wasn't clicking. I happened
to mention my mental block to Joe Heck, and a few days later, he produced
<a href='http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2009/11/04/setting-up-a-python-ci-server-with-hudson/'>Setting up a Python CI server with Hudson</a>.
It's a great step-by-step how-to covering everything you need to get Hudson
going for a Python project.
</p>

<p>Running through his guide finally cleared the last misconception for me:
continuous integration isn't a build tool or a test runner.  You don't run
Hudson on your development machine.  Sounds silly, but something needed to clear
it up, and this was it.</p>

<p>Thanks, Joe!</p>
