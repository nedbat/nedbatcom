<p><b>tl;dr</b>: I had half my thyroid removed. I'm fine. It's a big experience.</p>

<p>Back in September, I noticed a bulge in my neck.  It wasn't noticeable until
    I swallowed, it moved up and down with my adam's apple.  It didn't bother
    me in any way, but was big enough to see in a mirror.</p>

<p>I called the doctor, and he said, "Come in today," which was a bit alarming.
    He checked it out and pronounced it "odd, but not sinister," and explained
    that it was something on my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid'>thyroid gland</a>,
    that it's not uncommon, and rarely turns out to be bad.  And that even if
    it is cancer, it's one of the treatable kinds of cancer. Still, yikes!</p>

<p>He sent me to get an ultrasound so we could see what it was.  This would be
    the theme for this whole adventure: probably not bad, but let's do some
    more checking.  On the one hand, I was getting reassured, and on the other,
    I had another doctor or procedure to deal with.  The possibility of a bad
    outcome, which was small and kept getting smaller, was always still there,
    the procedures tended to be unpleasant, and the steady rhythm of doctor's
    appointments was a disruption to my treasured routine.</p>

<p>The ultrasound was simple but scary for what it might tell us. Also the
    technician had an unusual bedside manner, declaring that my thyroid was
    "ratty."  Nice.</p>

<p>The GP said the ultrasound showed a 4-centimeter nodule on my thyroid,
    though nothing bad seemed to be in it.  He referred me to an ear, nose and
    throat specialist, on the theory that even if it was totally benign, we'd
    want to take it out.</p>

<p>The ear, nose and throat guy cheerfully confirmed my GP's thinking, and sent
    me to get a needle biopsy.</p>

<p>A needle biopsy involves using a needle to extract tissue or fluid from
    some mysterious thing in your body.  I lay on a table, they numbed a spot
    on my neck, and then sucked goop out of me by sticking a vacuum-equipped
    needle into my neck five times.  As with many things like this, thinking
    about it is worse than actually experiencing it.</p>

<p>In this case, although it didn't hurt, I could feel a dull poking feeling in
    my neck, and knew that a needle was involved, and I could hear the
    disgusting slurping noise as the goop was collected.  Also, there was the
    part where the doctor and the technician were saying things like, "is it
    going? no, it's stuck, pull harder."  Ick.</p>

<p>But even there in the room, the doctor said that there were good signs
    (including the difficulty getting the goop to flow) which were reducing the
    "bad" chance even further.  Good.  Now they send the goop off to be tested,
    and we wait to hear back about the tests.</p>

<p>A week later, the tests came back fine, and it's time to schedule surgery, a
    hemithyroidectomy, the removal of half my thyroid.  The surgery is for two
    reasons: first, so they can truly examine every bit of the nodule for bad
    stuff, and second, because it won't go away by itself, and it's better not
    to have something like that inside you.</p>

<p>The operation makes me anxious: will it be difficult?  And will it change me
    in some important way?  Will I be less somehow?</p>

<p>At work, people are excited that I'll have a scar, and I say I already have
    a scar. "Really, where?"  Somehow they haven't noticed the one in the
    center of my forehead!  I guess they really do fade over time.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, surgery is a really big deal. It's kind of routine
    these days, but when it's actually happening to you, it's pretty involved.
    The week before the big day, I went to visit the pre-op nurse.  She ran me
    through a long checklist of questions.  There were the usual medical
    things, do you smoke, how often do you drink, are you allergic to anything,
    have you ever had a bad reaction to anesthesia, etc.  I answered no except
    where the good answer was yes.  I apologized to the nurse for being boring,
    and she laughed and said boring was good.  There were also some unusual
    questions like what is your preferred learning style (verbal, written,
    visual), which they ask so they know how best to instruct you for post-op
    tasks.</p>

<p>It was all very thorough, and I felt well cared for.  She gave me a bottle
    of soap to use in the shower for three days before the surgery.  The soap
    was to combat <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus'>MRSA</a>
    infections, which I hear are a big deal, so I did as I was told.  Also, no
    food or water the day of surgery, and don't bring any valuables to the
    hospital, not even a wedding ring.</p>

<p>The big day arrives, and I've been scheduled for a late start time (12:30),
    so I don't have to get to the hospital until 11, so I bide my time not
    eating or drinking with hacking on a memory-dump analysis tool we're using
    to try to find some memory problems:

    </p>

<p>Once at the hospital, we begin the pre-op process, which amounts to getting
    into a hospital gown, and lying in bed in a cubicle.  Other cubicles have
    other pre-op patients.  There's a lot of waiting for the next nurse to come
    around, and I can hear the patient across from me going through her
    process.  Remember the pre-op quiz where I answered no to everything?
    Sounds like she answered yes to everything, and the doctors and nurses are
    having a huddle to decide how to deal with it all.  I'm glad to be
    boring...</p>

<p>The nurses help me settle in.  The doctor comes by to say hi and draw on my
    neck where he'll be cutting.  The anesthesiologist comes to give me a
    nausea-suppressing patch behind my ear.</p>

<p>One of the things you get used to through all of this is that people are
    constantly double-checking that you're the right person by asking you your
    name and birthday.  After over an hour of talking to a handful of different
    nurses and the doctor and the anesthesiologist, one more nurse comes over
    and says, "is Ned your given name?"  I think she's just chatting, so I
    answer (truthfully), "no, it's Edward."  She immediately spins around and
    calls out, "You know this isn't his real name!?"  And another nurse comes
    over all aggravated and mutters about how she might have to redo all the
    paperwork, which is a half-inch binder full of forms and information.</p>

<p>We wait with that unexpected uncertainty for about 45 minutes, and finally a
    nice administrative person comes by to say that everything is fine, they'll
    add a note to the binder, and we can proceed. It's about 1:30 by now.</p>

<p>Then suddenly things go fast.  The anesthesiologist comes to wheel me to the
    operating room.  I get a quick look around, and it seems like a much more
    pedestrian room than I expected, but I scooch from the bed to the table,
    and people are fussing around me, and I remember someone fiddling with my
    feet (they use some kind of circulation-enhancing boots), and that's
    all I remember.</p>

<p>One of the side effects of general anesthesia is amnesia: you don't remember
    the short period of awake time before you really go under, and you don't
    remember the short period of awake time after you actually wake up.  So
    there's time where I was aware and talking to people in the operating room
    that are just lost to me. Weird.</p>

<p>Next thing I know, I am in bed feeling groggy.  Susan comes in, and I can
    have ginger ale and saltines.  She had brought a crossword puzzle, so we
    pass the time, her asking me clues and me trying to give her words.  After
    hanging out there for about 90 minutes, the nurses look me over, and make
    sure I'm coming out of it OK.  By the end of it, I'm light-headed, but can
    sit up and put on my clothes with help.  The nurse insists on putting on my
    shoes and socks so I don't have to bend over, but one of them feels funny
    so I redo it.  She comments on how I insist on fixing it, with a mixture of
    dismay and admiration, so she knows we're good to go home.</p>

<p>We get home after dinner, and I just want to lie around.  My son
    Ben looks at me funny like I'm acting weird which is fine, I probably am.
    The scar is two inches long, horizontal, just below the neckline extending
    to the right from my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprasternal_notch'>jugular notch</a>.
    It's scary and red, and covered with glue (!), but doesn't hurt. My
    throat is sore, I think mostly from the tube they put down my throat.</p>

<p>I have five days at home to recover, including the Veteran's Day holiday.
    <a href='http://susansenator.com/blog/2013/11/be-prepared-to-bleed/'>Susan</a>
    pampers me, promising as much pie as I want! Nat was a little concerned
    about the change in me and in the routine.  His Facebook summary of the
    situation: "Dad got sik".</p>

<p>Tuesday I can go back to work, though I still feel a bit like I had Nyquil
    the night before.  My head is just a touch light-headed, and my throat is
    still a little tender, but somehow the incision never hurt.  How can "a guy
    attack me with a knife" (as I described the procedure a few times) and it
    doesn't hurt?</p>

<p>We go to see the specialist one last time to hear about the final pathology
    reports on the removed nodule.  He starts off with, "The good news is, the
    pathology reports are fine, ..." and proceeds to tell us all sorts of
    details about what they found in the thing, none of which were bad.  But he
    had said, "the good news is," so the whole time, Susan and I are both
    thinking, what's part B?</p>

<p>She finally asks him, "is there any bad news?"  No, he says, there isn't
    any bad news.  He doesn't know how to English as well as he knows how to
    surgery!</p>

<p>Now, two weeks after the operation, the scar is healing great, and
    everything is back to normal.  My thyroid hormone levels seem fine, so I
    don't even need to take a synthetic replacement.</p>

<p>The whole process was a mixture of dread and anxiety about what might happen
    in the long term (will I have a horrible diagnosis?) and dread and anxiety
    about what might happen in the short term (will this hurt?).  Of course,
    this was fairly minor in the scheme of things, and there are far worse
    problems. But it made me stop and consider, and it was something Susan and
    I had to deal with together, which we did well.</p>

<p>Now that it's over, lots of my fears didn't come to pass.  I'm the same
    person I was before, and I feel fine.  There's no lasting effect, except
    for a scar, which will fade with time.</p>

<p>I'm glad to be healthy, I'm glad to have it behind me, and I'll be glad to
    show you my scars.</p>
