<title>Whitespace in Ruby and searching for code</title>

<p>Armin's post about <a href='http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2008/7/1/whitespace-sensitivity'>Whitespace sensitivity</a>
in Ruby piqued my interest.  It points out that in Ruby, <c>foo[42]</c>
is different than <c>foo [42]</c> and that <c>foo/bar</c>
is the same as <c>foo / bar</c> but different than <c>foo /bar</c>.
</p>

<p>So I wanted to learn more about Ruby, and looked at a bunch of tutorials,
finally ending up at Mitch Fincher's <a href='http://www.fincher.org/tips/Languages/Ruby/'>Ruby Tutorial with Code Samples</a>,
which had the right breezy pace with no, "a variable is like a box for your numbers" stuff in it.</p>

<p>But I had originally gotten to Mitch's page from a Google search for
<a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=ruby%20puts%20gets'>ruby puts gets</a>.
If you try it, you'll see that when you get to Mitch's page, a small box appears
near the top, saying,</p>

<box>Welcome. You seem to have come here from a search engine. Your search words (ruby puts gets) are highlighted on this page for your reading pleasure.</box>

<p>I thought "nice,"  then I thought, "that looks familiar," then I realized it
was almost exactly the box that appears at the top of my pages when you visit
from a search engine (try it: <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=batchelder+white+house+adventure'>batchelder white house adventure</a>).
In fact, it used the same colors.  I looked at his page, and it used near-verbatim
copies of my three Javascript files, though a few years ago I consolidated them
into one.</p>

<p>I was amused, and wondered where else the code is being used.  But the search
engines are smart enough not to index comments in Javascript files, or names of
Javascript files referenced in HTML pages, unless there's some tricky syntax I
don't know about.
</p>

<p>PS: about whitespace sensitivity: I've decided that phrase means a programming
language needs tokens consisting of only whitespace in order to be parsed
properly.  Python and Ruby are whitespace-sensitive, and C is not, for example.
