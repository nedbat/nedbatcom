<title>Coalescing Python parser info?</title>
<category>online</category>
<via />
<body>
<p>Last year, I wanted a parser generator for a Python program I was working on, and I went in
search of a tool.  As is typical in the Python world, I found many, of varying degrees of
maturity, activity, and depth.  To make sense of it all, I compiled a
<a href='text/python-parsers.html'>list of Python parsing tools</a> and put it on my site.
</p>

<p>Since then, many people have found it.  About ten people a day come to this site with search
queries like "python parsing", "bison for python", "lexical analyzer python", and the like.</p>

<p>Recently, though, <a href='http://www.broofa.com'>Robert Kieffer</a> wrote to me,
asking me to do the Right Thing:</p>

<p>Hi Ned,</p>
<p>I just ran across your python parser page.  Great information!</p>

<p>However, I stumbled across your page only after also finding
<a href='http://wiki.python.org/moin/LanguageParsing'>http://wiki.python.org/moin/LanguageParsing</a>.
One of the commenters on your page, "Henning", also refers to this url.</p>

<p>If I may be so bold, it seems like the Right Thing (tm) to do here is to
transition the information on your site to the python.org page.  Since
python.org is a Wiki, it will be easier to maintain and contribute to.
Also, by virtue of being on the python.org site it has at least the
appearance of being a little more legitimate.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to update the python.org page, assuming you're interested.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I've thought a lot about this very issue, and I'm torn.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I know that the spirit of sharing is very strong in the
Python community, and it is that spirit which has made it so great.  I want
to contribute, and give back to the community.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I want (selfishly, to be honest) to be strongly
associated with the work I put into my site.  And I want to have more
control over the content than the wiki page would afford me.</p>

<p>Balancing these forces is tricky.  I think I will leave my parser info where
it is.  After all, it is freely available to the community where it is, so I
am giving back.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to use my page to update the wiki page, that's fine
too.  I can understand why you wouldn't want to if my page will continue on
where it is.</p>

<p>What's your take on these issues: do you think I am doing The Wrong Thing by
not merging the pages?</p>

<p>Hey Ned,</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.  I have to confess that I sympathize with your
dillemma.  It's tough to give freely what you've worked so hard on.  That said,
I also know that as one ponders these things the idea tends to grow on you.</p>

<p>I actually began a response talking about how I believe the roll of a
programmer is changing, but it became so philosophical (and long-winded) that I
decided to turn it into a
<a href='http://www.broofa.com/blog/index.php?p=56'>blog entry</a>.
The essence of it is that we come from a generation of
developers that find this open-sharing of code and information a little
unnatural, and that it is something we will consciously have to embrace. The
risk of not doing this is obsolescence.</p>

<p>So, are you doing "The Wrong Thing"?  Well... yes.</p>

<p>I really, really, want to be nice and say, "no, of course not!" but I just
can't.  So, yes it's wrong, but not because it stems from selfish motivations.
a) They aren't that selfish (you are publicizing this stuff after all) and b)
recognition for our effort is what motivates all of us <emdash/> it's a good thing.
Rather, it's wrong because keeping this information in two places derails the
inspiration that originally led you to create that page <emdash/> that is, the goal of
having a single, comprehensive source for information about Python language
parsers.</p>

<p>The fact you put this information on your website speaks to your desire to
help people.  You just need to go one step further and put that information in
the obvious place for it.  As for recognition, I think it would be fine for you
to put a note at the top of the Wiki page to the effect that you compiled the
information and would like to be involved (read, "coordinate") efforts to keep
it current.</p>

<p>So, now I ask my readers: what do you think?  I still want to leave the page
where it is.  People are obviously able to find it, and I can put a link on the
wiki page for people who don't.  Does the spirit of sharing demand centralization?
Is my desire for control at odds with the greater good?
Am I an old timer who doesn't fully get it?
