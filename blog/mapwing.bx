<p>I created <a href='code/nats-world.html'>Nat's World</a>, my immersive photo exploration game,
the hard way: each picture is added into the environment by adding a line to a large Python file.
It worked for me because I'm a geek, and it was quick to get the whole thing going.
But I've idly toyed with the idea of building a GUI application to create similar environments.
I think it would be fun to write, but I've never seriously started on it.</p>

<p>Redbug Technologies now has <a href='http://www.redbugtech.com'>Mapwing</a>, a commercial product
to build the same type of walkthroughs.  I haven't tried it, but they've got a few demos on their
site.  It was interesting to see that they faced some of the same problems I did, for example,
how to show a simple photo of a spot without it being a fully-realized four-direction point you could
navigate to.  They did it by putting a camera icon on the spot before you get there.  I did it by
drawing a thick white border around the photo (to make it like a snapshot).
